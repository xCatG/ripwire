// ── §B12.7 + CA4 verifier F-MED-1 — THE C0 DIALECT DIVERGENCE, AND ITS TELL ─────────────────────────────
// The XML and JSON dialects do not agree about C0 controls and invalid UTF-8, and they CANNOT: XML 1.0
// forbids the C0 set even escaped (only \t \n \r are legal Chars) so xmlSafeByte must substitute a space,
// and an invalid sequence must become '?', while JSON has \u00XX for every control byte. jsonesc.h's own
// header records the decision from the other side: the JSON escaper is the FAITHFUL one and stays faithful,
// because normalizing there would make the two dialects agree by making BOTH lossy.
//
// What was wrong was not the divergence — it was that the lossy side said nothing. `<ctx task=…>`, whose
// entire §B1.7 point is being the VERBATIM copy of the user's task, silently was not; and `EmittedBody::text`
// is recorded at packBodies' push_back BEFORE appendCdataSafe, so a def holding ESC + Latin-1 reached XML at
// 140 B scrubbed and JSON at 148 B raw with nothing anywhere saying so.
//
// So the lossy side now DISCLOSES: `scrubbed="1"` on the XML surface that lost bytes, and its JSON twin
// beside the same field — the JSON is byte-faithful and does not need the warning for itself, but a consumer
// diffing the two dialects is owed the fact from either one. THE MARKERS ARE A CLOSED SET, and each XML one
// has exactly one JSON counterpart: `task_scrubbed=`/`route_scrubbed=` on the root (ctxRootOpen) twin
// `"task_xml_scrubbed"`/`"route_xml_scrubbed"` (ctxRootJsonScrubKeys, right below it — one function, so a
// call site cannot emit the field and skip the question), and `<b scrubbed="1">` twins `"xml_scrubbed"` on
// the JSON body object. test/bodydialectcheck.sh arm (H) sweeps that table in BOTH directions rather than
// the one marker that already worked. This predicate is the single decision behind all six: true iff
// escapeXml/appendCdataSafe would CHANGE bytes (a C0 other than \t\n\r, or an invalid UTF-8 sequence).

//       string than the user typed — §B1.7's whole point is that the attribute is the verbatim copy.

// **Never `snprintf` ALREADY-ESCAPED or already-markup text into a fixed `char[]`.** Compose it on
// `std::string`.
//
// The test that separates a breaching site from a safe one is WHICH SIDE OF THE BUFFER THE ESCAPER SITS ON:
//   escape-then-snprintf  → the cut lands in the ESCAPED form: mid-entity (`&am`), mid-attribute-name,
//                           mid-UTF-8 sequence, or before the element's own `/>`. The document is broken and
//                           the process still exits 0 — a G4 breach a caller cannot detect.
//   snprintf-then-escape  → the cut only shortens PROSE, and the escaper then runs over the shortened text.
//                           Ugly, never malformed. `lanes.h:698`/`:723` are safe for exactly this reason.
// The escaping is what makes truncation dangerous, not the length: a 512-byte buffer breaks at 228 RAW bytes
// once `&` expands 5:1 and `'` 6:1 before the buffer is written.
//
// A CLAMP IS THE WRONG REMEDY (§H1's recorded reason): it trades a visible breach for a silently wrong path.
// Truncation that must happen belongs to the budget layer, which emits a marker; a buffer must never decide it.
//
// Three occurrences before the rule was swept — `tracelocus.h`'s `char row[640]` (gated, tracelocus only),
// `gitmine.h`'s input-side twin (gated, gitmine only), then §B14's six emitters. `test/fixedbufsweep.sh` is
// the sweep: it re-derives EVERY `snprintf` call in `src/` that interpolates a `%s`, classifies each against
// a committed table, and FAILS on any call the table does not know about — so the next one is a red gate on
// the commit that introduces it, not a finding three rounds later.
//
// W3FIX M3 — THE ONE COMMENT-ECHO SCRUB. Every task-shaped verb echoes the user's own query inside an XML
// COMMENT, and each site hand-rolled the SAME '--'-collapse (main.cpp --for, packtask.h, mcpverbs.h, exemplar,
// tracelocus.h) while none of them scrubbed the bytes an XML comment cannot carry. So `--for=$'a\001b'` and
// `--pack-task=$'a\377b'` both made xmllint reject the whole document (G4), and `$'a\nb'` put a raw newline
// outside CDATA — the ATTRIBUTE half of §B1.7 was hardened by escapeXml and the comment half was not.
//
// The comment is the READABLE echo (the attribute beside it is the verbatim one), so the scrub is lossy on
// purpose and states its three rules in one place:
//   1. '--' runs collapse to a single '-'   — "--" is ill-formed inside a comment and "-->" would close it;
//   2. every control byte becomes a space   — C0 is illegal XML even escaped (xmlSafeByte), and \t\n\r are
//      legal XML but forbidden outside CDATA by G4; a character reference is NOT expanded inside a comment,
//      so `&#10;` there would be literal text pretending to be an escape — a space is the honest scrub;
//   3. an invalid UTF-8 sequence becomes '?' — same rule appendCdataSafe applies to bodies.
// Byte-identical to the hand-rolled std::unique collapse for every input that carried no control byte and no
// invalid sequence, which is what makes it a drop-in everywhere the old collapse stood. A trailing '-' is
// deliberately KEPT: no site ends its comment with user text (fixed legend prose always follows), so "a-"
// cannot become "--->" and dropping it would silently lose a character the reader typed. Pure text in, pure
// text out.
//

// sites", and that count had rotted: `main.cpp`'s queryRouteNote was never converted, so the true figure was
// never six, and a reader auditing from the comment alone would have stopped one site short — trap #5/#12).
// The honest form is a LIST, not a number, and it is machine-checked: `test/fixedbufsweep.sh` re-derives
// `git grep -c 'xmlCommentText(' -- src/` (excluding this definition) and FAILS if it disagrees with the

// the right answer not fitting where the WRONG one-line forward declaration always had.
//
// So when the route is at its MOST certain about what the caller wants — a name-exact query whose anchor
// resolved to a definition, and a candidate set of exactly one — that one body is funded at a one-body

//     fact about the input rather than an accounting argument; an anchored bundle with 2+ same-named
//     definitions in the anchor's file keeps the fixed pool;
//   • not a repeal of whole-body-or-nothing — truncateOversizedFirst stays false, so a definition larger
//     than THIS ceiling is still dropped and disclosed. The honest zero does not go away; it moves.

//     0.7–1.0 KB per query in the same head-to-head round.
//
// IT BUDGETS THE WHOLE COMPACT SURFACE, not just the rows. The first registration draft priced the hops
// alone and left the legend, the root attribute and the section wrapper riding free — the same "a
// disclosure has BYTES" trap the --for root legend already recorded once. Corrected before any compact

// ── THE est_tokens FAMILY'S ONE BUFFER SEAM, and the fault switch that makes its degrade path REACHABLE ──
// The wave-1 verifier's declared coverage debt: these `open_memstream` failure paths were NEVER exercised,
// so trap #3 ("a gate arm that asserts a degrade path must FAIL, not skip, on a build that cannot observe
// alerts") was unanswered for §H7. `open_memstream` fails on ALLOCATION, not on fd exhaustion, so no
// `ulimit -n` harness comes near it — the failure has to be injected.
//
// One seam for two reasons. (1) The family's degrade CONTRACT is one contract — the section/document still
// emits complete, correct bytes; est_tokens falls back to the MODELLED number; a DEGRADED_PATH_ALERT says
// which — and a contract restated at five call sites is a contract that diverges at one of them.
// (2) A single switch then exercises the whole family, which is what test/estchargecheck.sh's degrade arm
// asserts against.
//
// THE SWITCH EXISTS ONLY ON THE NON-NDEBUG FLAVOUR — the same flavour `DEGRADED_PATH_ALERT` itself exists
// on. The hook and the observation it enables therefore appear and disappear TOGETHER: a release build has
// neither, and `isChargeBufferFaultInjected()` is `constexpr false` there, so the branch and the getenv are
// both deleted (G2/G3: zero release cost, no behaviour to diverge). Read ONCE per process, so the answer
// cannot change mid-document and determinism holds.
//
// REJECTED ALTERNATIVE (the brief asks for a hook-free route if one is cleaner): interposing
// `open_memstream` itself — macOS `__DATA,__interpose` + DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES, Linux LD_PRELOAD. It needs a
// per-platform shim compiled inside the gate; it fails EVERY memstream in the process, including the cache
// and sidecar paths, which confounds the very assertion that matters ("the bytes are still complete and
// correct"); and it fights the ASan runtime, which this gate must also run under. Scoping the fault to the
// est_tokens family is what keeps the assertions clean, so the in-source switch wins on honesty, not effort.

// bytes (the DENSEST calibrated language rate x a 90% headroom, so N is a cap that holds for any language
// mix and any tokenizer drift), while est_tokens is this corpus's own language-weighted estimate — so a

// Kept DELIBERATELY terse — it is charged against the very ceiling it describes (--max-tokens=500 buys only
// ~1062 bytes in total), so the full statement of the consequence lives in --help, not here.
// G4: no "--" ANYWHERE inside an XML comment. The flag names this clause has to talk about are therefore
// written bare ("token-budget", not "--token-budget"); spelling one with its dashes made xmllint reject the
// whole document ("Double hyphen within comment"), caught by tokenbudgetcheck #5.
// §F5: the clause also has to define over_ceiling, because THIS clause is part of the very floor that makes it
// fire — at a small max_tokens the legend plus the envelope exceed fit_bytes with zero symbols emitted, and a
// marker no legend defines is the §B7 class this round is already closing. Kept to one hyphenated phrase for

// --max-tokens budgets the floor has ~24 bytes of headroom (test/tokenbudgetcheck.sh arm #3), so a 17-byte

// first. Over that round's twelve symbol-lookup queries those rows were 64-84% of a class-A bundle's bytes
// (mean ~73%), and 17.5% of everything the tool emitted across the whole 48-query sweep. It is NOT those
// directories: excluding them refilled with the next files in path order and the bundle got BIGGER.
//
// WHERE THE CALLER APPLIES IT. On the FINAL lens rank — after route, anchor, mention, co-change and
// doc-mention have all landed — so a row still at zero matched no query term under any of them. --for's
// forTopN is the one knob every consumer reads (the sigs quota, lensSurfaceIds, the lego/compose scope,
// the JSON dialect, the auto-bodies set), so narrowing it there floors all of them at once. The emitters
// take the floor as a flag TOO, and that is not belt-and-braces: their `topN == 0 ⇒ all` convention makes
// an empty kept set unrepresentable through the count alone, and a query nothing scores on must emit zero
// rows, not the corpus.
//
// The caller-side half of the floor: how many slots of the quota survive it, and the note that says so.
// ONE spelling for both --for dialects (CLI runForLens, MCP forTaskText) — a bundle-composition rule with
// two implementations is a rule with two behaviours, which is the drift class the §B4 echo-site rule and
// this file's own shared trim ladder both exist to stop. Structured-binding return (CONTRIBUTING §3) rather
// than an in/out `int&` so the caller cannot forget the note.
//

// than you asked for, here is by how much and why.

//
// WHAT IT COUNTS. `candidatePositives` is how many symbols in the ladder's kept head scored ABOVE the
// relevance floor (rank>0) — positives by the ranker's OWN cut, independent of whether relevanceFloorCut
// was applied to narrow topN first (LB-A already guarantees every --for kept symbol is positive; --pack-task
// never applies that narrowing, so its eligible set can still mix positive and zero-score members — this
// arithmetic works either way because it re-checks rank>0 per symbol rather than assuming the caller floored
// first). Of those, `positivesContentSkipped` never became a <sigs> row for a CONTENT reason (an unreadable
// file, an out-of-range sig span, an empty cleaned signature) — not a budget reason, so THE DISCLOSURE (a
// count of what the PAYLOAD CEILING removed) must not blame the ceiling for it. `positivesSurvived` is how
// many actually reached the final emitted set (collected AND not later dropped by the H1 ladder's step F).
// Every candidate positive falls into exactly one of three buckets — content-skipped, budget-dropped (never
// collected because the collection-phase byte gate broke first, or collected then step-F dropped), or
// survived — so subtracting the first and third from the total leaves exactly the second, with no need to
// track "never visited due to budget" as its own running counter.
//
// BAND (docs/EVALS.md, A2 registration): this count must be EXACTLY correct on every one of the standing
// --for-gate sweep's serving shapes — a floor label (`_floor`/`_capped`) is for a count that admits it might
// be short; this one has no such hedge, so getting it wrong is worse than not shipping it at all.

// ── §A4a — THE ONE SIGNATURE-PAYLOAD TRIM LADDER (steps A..F, kForPayloadBudgetBytes above) ──────────
// Extracted from packSignatures so the JSON sibling runs the SAME ladder rather than a second copy of it:
// §A4a found `--for --json` byte-identical at --token-budget=1000 and 20000 because the
// JSON emitter had no budget at all, and the honest fix is one ladder with two serializations — a cloned
// ladder is exactly the "new clone of a reused helper" --quality-delta gates on, and two copies is how the
// XML and JSON trims would silently diverge one round from now.
//
// Format-agnostic by construction: every decision it makes reads only (globalRank, doc, sig, dropped, fileSlot)
// on an entry and (wrapBytes, liveCount) on its file — never a tag, brace, or quote. The
// FORMAT lives entirely in the caller's `entryCost`, which reports the exact emitted byte cost of one entry
// in that caller's own serialization (0 for a dropped entry). Templated on the caller's own row structs
// (duck-typed on those member names) so neither emitter has to reshape its rows to call this.
//
// `total` is the running exact byte total of the whole block and is updated in place. NOTE on the delta
// order: an action can GROW an entry by a couple of bytes (the appended ellipsis on a barely-over string),
// so subtract the old cost first and add the new one — never form `before - after` (it can be negative,
// i.e. unsigned-overflow UB under G1's -fsanitize=integer). `total >= before` always holds (before is a
// summand of total).

// now all taken it (their `redact` is the LAST parameter, so dropping the default costs nothing). Here it is
// a MIDDLE parameter with six more defaulted parameters behind it, and C++ requires defaults to be trailing:
// removing this one is ill-formed unless churnPerFile/cloneMember/tested/amp/rankAdaptivePayload/
// payloadBudgetBytes/noteIndex all lose theirs too, which rewrites every call site across main.cpp,
// mcpverbs.h, packtask.h and tracelocus.h — four files, three concurrent lanes. packBodies is the same shape
// (four trailing defaults). So the compile net is 8 of 10, and the two the compiler cannot hold are held by
// test/fixedbufsweep.sh's population sweep instead: a new sig/body emitter shows up there as an
// unclassified site. Reordering the parameter list is the real fix and belongs to a round that owns all four

// ripwire stays deterministic and offline and hands a reranker precisely the identity + score + signature it
// needs, nothing to strip. Still XML so the G4 xmllint gate holds; the flatness is what makes it cheap.
// Deterministic: (score desc, id asc) — the SAME total order packSignatures/serialize select with. `cap`
// bounds the row count (wired to --top-k); cap<=0 = every symbol. Emits exactly `keep` rows (a symbol whose
// signature span is unreadable still gets a row with an empty <sig/>) so a consumer can trust row-count==cap.
//
// §A4e/§A4f — the RANKING PROVENANCE this export used to carry none of. An external reranker was handed a

// anchor-lifted, how much of the corpus the top-k cut away, or that the whole ranking rested on no textual
// evidence at all (the §P5 weak signal was string-spliced into the XML lens header, structurally out of
// reach here — for a nonsense query this exported 200 rows of s="0" as a straight-faced candidate set).

// ── §H5: THE RECORD OF WHAT packBodies ACTUALLY EMITTED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `--pack-task --json` used to answer "which bodies?" a SECOND time, in a second place, from the same inputs:
// the XML pass handed every candidate to packBodies (which groups by FILE and stops on a BYTE budget), counted
// the resulting <b> elements as bodies_kept, and the JSON tail then re-sliced the first bodies_kept ids in
// RANK order and emitted each one WHOLE. Two answers, one number over both: MEASURED on this repo at
// --token-budget=8000, XML kept {redactInPlace, redactSecrets} while JSON emitted {redactInPlace,
// loadRecallBody} under bodies_kept=2; on `--pack-task="serializeJson runDefaultMap" --token-budget=5000` the
// XML truncated its single body to fit 11 800 B while the JSON shipped 42 200 B against the SAME stated
// ceiling — packBodiesJson had no budgetBytes parameter, no `used`, and no truncation vocabulary at all.
//
// The fix is not a second budget in the JSON emitter (that is how the divergence was born). packBodies is the
// ONE place the decisions live, and it now REPORTS them: which ids it emitted, the exact post-slice /
// post-compress / post-redact bytes it emitted for each, whether it truncated, and the callee rows it showed.
// The JSON dialect renders that record. Same SET, same SELECTION, same TRUNCATION, by construction — a future
// third dialect gets those for free, because there is nothing to keep in step.
//
// NOT the same BYTES, and this comment said otherwise until the wave-2 verifier caught it (F-MED-1). The
// record is taken at the push_back below, i.e. BEFORE `appendCdataSafe`, and that is not an escape — it is a
// LOSSY SCRUB: `xmlSafeByte` maps every C0 byte except \t \n \r to a space, and invalid UTF-8 becomes '?'.
// So a body containing ESC or Latin-1 bytes reaches XML scrubbed and JSON raw (measured: 140 B vs 148 B on a
// fixture whose def holds ESC + Latin-1, at every budget and under --compress/--no-redact). The divergence is
// PRE-EXISTING and base-byte-identical — the wave regressed nothing — but it is real, it is the §B12.7 C0
// dialect divergence appearing in the body payload rather than the task echo, and `bodydialectcheck` cannot
// see it because that gate asserts sets, truncations and omissions, never body bytes. Routed to the wave-3
// lane that owns this file together with §B12.7. Do not restore the unqualified claim without closing it.
//
// The record also removes a latent counting bug: bodies_kept was `countSub( bodiesStr, "<b " )`, and body text
// rides in CDATA verbatim, so any corpus body containing the literal `<b ` (HTML, a markdown table, this
// comment) inflated the count.

// THE <bodies> DISCLOSURE (§B8.3). This was the one budgeted section element carrying NO attributes at all:
// "kept N of M" lived in the --pack-task header's comment prose while the JSON twin emitted
// bodies_total/bodies_kept, so the two dialects disclosed different amounts of one fact — and
// `truncvocabcheck`'s universal sweep could not even see the element, because every rule it applies is of the
// form "if shown= then …". It now carries the pageview.h rule-1/2/3 triple. `shown` is a RESULT of the budget
// walk rather than an input to it, so the open tag cannot be written until the walk has finished: the children
// are composed into a buffer and the tag is written in front of them. A second, non-emitting decision pass to
// pre-count `shown` was rejected — it would re-run redactInPlace over every body and double the redaction
// tally, which is §B10.2 recreated one file over.
//
// THE BUDGET WALK (§H5 sub-finding, RE-DIAGNOSED BY MEASUREMENT). The audit reported bodies_kept as
// non-monotonic in the budget and named the cause: "packBodies `break`s rather than skipping". It does not.
// The loops already skip-and-continue for a body that does not fit while budget REMAINS (the marker path
// below); the `break` fires only once `used` has reached the budget, when nothing further can fit anyway.
// Converting both breaks to skips and sweeping 8 tasks x 27 budgets (3000..16000 step 500) gives the
// IDENTICAL 5 descending steps at the IDENTICAL budgets — exactly count-neutral.
// CA4 verifier F-LOW-2: count-neutral is NOT marker-neutral, and the sentence above used to stop one word
// short. The two forms disagree on how many `<!-- body omitted (over budget): NAME -->` markers are printed
// for the SAME set of dropped bodies, because a `break` stops writing them while a skip keeps going:
// measured `--token-budget=7000` -> shown=2/6 with ZERO markers, `=8000` -> shown=2/6 with FOUR markers for
// the same four bodies. Nothing is hidden by it — the aggregate `capped="1"` plus shown=/total= carry the
// fact either way, and the JSON `bodies_omitted` key is built from the same set — but a reader diffing two
// budgets sees a marker count move without the body count moving, and is owed the reason here.
//
// The real cause is RANK PRIORITY, and it is not a defect: bodies fill top-rank-first, so a larger budget can
// newly admit a large high-rank body that then consumes the room several smaller low-rank ones had. MEASURED
// `--pack-task="redact secrets from emitted text"`: 5 bodies at --token-budget=6500, 2 at 7000, while the
// delivered bytes went UP (8 687 -> 11 461). Making the count monotone means filling smallest-first, i.e.
// handing an agent four small bodies it did not ask for instead of the one it did. Rank priority is the
// retrieval contract; the count is not a quality measure, and the --pack-task header now SAYS so rather than
// leaving a reader to infer a regression from a falling number.
//
// What the re-diagnosis DID fix: `budgetBytes - used` underflows a size_t whenever `used` has passed the
// budget (appendCdataSafe grows on a `]]>` split, and the callee block and notes are charged after the fit
// test), turning the fit test into "everything fits". The guard happens to mask it today, so the floored form
// is a latent trap defused, not an output change.

// walk passes noteIndex=nullptr rather than duplicating them.
//
// RANK ORDER, not file order, and that is a real difference from packBodies rather than an oversight.
// packBodies groups its requests by file so each file is read exactly once for the body text; an <h>
// row needs no file bytes at all (a name and a line come from the symbol table) — so there is nothing to
// group for, and walking `nodes` in the order the caller ranked them spends the budget on the
// best-ranked symbols first.
//
// A candidate with no resolved out-edges gets NO row and is counted in `noedge=` instead — see the loop
// for why that is the honest form rather than the cheap one. Call edges are name-based, so dynamic
// dispatch, callbacks and macros can be missing: `noedge=` means none FOUND, never none exists
// (CONTRIBUTING #3), and it is deliberately a separate number from `capped=`, which says only that the

// one <src p= sym=> block per DISTINCT file of the requested nodes (first-appearance order — nodes is
// already deterministic), the file body CDATA-wrapped through the same redact + scrub pipeline
// packSource uses, sym= carrying every requested symbol's name:line anchor, and each symbol's field
// notes still surfaced (L3 — the notes must not vanish just because the serving form changed).
// D2 (audit regressions, 2026-08-08): body-shaping modifiers COMPOSE with this form instead of being
// silently dropped when the serving mode flips —
//   * compress=true strips comments through the SAME compressBody + anti-growth guard packBodies uses,
//     so a --compress caller gets a compressed file, not a silently-uncompressed one (compresscheck);
//   * each requested symbol whose canonical id ADDS an enclosing scope (the S6-C rule — canon != bare
//     name) gets an <s n= id= l=/> anchor row before the CDATA, so the canonical-id surface downstream
//     tooling reads off --expand output (usesselectorcheck resolves NoteIndex::empty through it) does
//     not vanish with the ranked map.
// rawBytes is the Σ of the SERVED body bytes — post-compress when compress is on, the raw on-disk
// bytes otherwise — the number the caller's reason= attribute discloses and compares, so the auto
// choice always weighs SHAPED candidate against SHAPED candidate. The rendered form differs from it

// is identical to the XML: stable key EMISSION order (== the XML attr order), the same float-formatting
// path (bytesPerTokenFor / "%.4f" / estimateTokens — never a second counter), 2-run byte-diff clean.
// Escaping reuses the ONE canonical JSON core (jsonesc.h) at the same posture as mcp.h's stdio JSON-RPC
// output (escapeMcp): no <>& hardening (this is a CLI stdout stream, never re-embedded in HTML/markup),
// UTF-8-validated with raw U+FFFD bytes on an invalid sequence — see jsonesc.h's posture rationale.
//
// Scope note (documented, not a silent gap): the --for/--pack-task JSON ranking section applies the
// SAME rank-tier doc/sig trimming as the XML (kForDocFullRankCount/kForDocExcerptRankCount/kForTailSigBytes)
// but does NOT run the XML's H1 global-budget LADDER (serialize.h kForPayloadBudgetBytes) — that ladder
// exists to fit an XML-byte budget and re-deriving it against a second (JSON) byte model would be a
// second source of truth for the same decision. In the ordinary case (result fits under budget without
// the ladder engaging) the two are byte-for-byte the same SET of entries; only a bundle so large the XML
// ladder had to trim further can diverge, and only in how AGGRESSIVELY the tail is cut, never in what the

//     `"roots"`/`"roots_count"` now mirror the XML `roots=` + `<root label= p=/>` prologue exactly.
//   * overloads: this emitter never called collapseOverloadRows(), so a const/non-const pair printed TWO
//     byte-identical rows and a consumer keying on "id" silently lost one. Collapsed here as in the XML,
//     with the same `"overloads":N` (>1 only) discriminator.
