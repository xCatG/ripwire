// graphlegend.h — the ONE floor marker and the ONE shared legend wording for the five GRAPH-COUNT verbs
// (--uses, --callers, --callees, --impact, --edit-check).
//
// WHY A HEADER AND NOT FIVE STRING LITERALS. Each of these verbs answers with a NUMBER a reader treats as
// exhaustive ("count=1 caller, so one call site to fix"). §H4 proved the number can be silently short: a
// plainly written `ns::inner::fn()` produced no reference at all, so --edit-check said callers="1" about a
// symbol with two callers and nothing in the document hinted otherwise. The widening (option A) fixed the
// qualified-call class; it did NOT — and no static extractor can — fix dynamic dispatch, callbacks, macros
// or most-vexing-parse declarations. So the counts stay FLOORS, and every one of the five has to say so in
// the SAME words: the round-series' standing law is that a CLI legend and its MCP twin are byte-identical
// wording, and the §B4 failure family is exactly "the clause landed at 3 of its 5 echo sites".
//
// THE ATTRIBUTE. `counts_floor="1"` (XML) / `"counts_floor":true` (JSON), appended LAST on the root element
// of all five verbs, in every dialect they ship (XML, --format=columnar, --json, and the MCP payloads).
// It is deliberately NOT spelled with the `_capped` suffix of src/pageview.h rule 4: that marker means "a
// CAP or a BUDGET stopped the scan before it finished counting", which is a property of THIS RUN and is
// raisable with limit=N. This one means "the underlying graph does not model every call", which no flag can
// raise. Two different facts under one attribute name is the §P8 collision class, so they get two names.
// It is a constant "1" today because the tool cannot detect the absence it is disclosing — a 0 would be a
// claim of exhaustiveness that nothing in the pipeline can support.
//
// H8 AMENDMENT (capture-audit 2026-09-04). The READING of counts_floor= is "every count on this element
// is a floor"; the CAUSE is disclosed beside it, never encoded in the name. On a graph verb the cause is the
// floor sentence below (the graph misses edges — nothing raises it). On a collection-capped scan (--match /
// --lint / --grep / --pattern / --ensemble / --quality-panel) the cause is the rule-4 marker on the same root
// (hits_capped= / findings_capped=) and it IS raisable — narrow the query. Two causes, one reading, one
// attribute: a parser that treats counts_floor="1" as "do not trust these totals" is right in both cases,
// which it was not when the capped scans carried no marker at all and printed has_more="0" capped="0" over
// a floored total (the complete-last-page lie). pageview.h's PageSyntax::floor spells the identical bytes.
//
// Gate: test/floormarkcheck.sh (all five verbs, CLI ≡ MCP wording, and the retired absolutism absent).

// M15 (capture-audit 2026-09-04, lens 7 F-GAUGE-1) — THE GAUGE PAIR. Every graph verb said "floor" and none
// said HOW MUCH of the graph was guessed; the magnitude lived only in the map header's ambiguous=/unresolved=,
// on a verb the agent had not run. Every root that carries the graph's counts_floor="1" now carries the same
// two whole-graph numbers beside it — graph_ambiguous= (calls the resolver split over several in-repo defs,
// graph.h ambOut) and graph_unresolved= (calls to an in-repo name whose every def was language-filtered,
// unresolvedOut) — computed by the ONE fold the map header uses, so the pair can never be a second
// derivation. Gate: test/floormarkcheck.sh arm (11) (value-equal to the map header on the same corpus).
//
// #66 THIRD GAUGE (2026-09-08, @snrmwg). `graph_unindexed=` joins the pair: the files the crawl could not
// read AT ALL (the map header's `unindexed=` roll-up, summed to files). It answers the question the other
// two cannot — a call FROM a file that was never parsed produces no reference, so it can raise neither
// ambOut nor unresolvedOut, and the reporter's corpus showed both sitting at 0 beside a count="0" whose
// real cause was 154 unread .astro files. OMITTED AT ZERO, unlike the pair: absence is the confident case
// ("no file in this corpus went unread"), and a marker printed on every root of every clean corpus is one
// ONE fold for both dialects: the XML and JSON emitters each summed these inline, which made them a
// clone pair the moment a third gauge widened both (--quality-delta, 2026-09-08).
