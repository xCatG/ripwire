// call graph) land at 13 without disturbing that file. Json is lang-incompatible with everything but
// itself via langCompatible (graph.h) and emits ZERO references, so it never forms cross-language edges.
// CSharp is appended AFTER Json for the SAME reason (B6.2): it reuses Json's headroom — index 14 also
// clamps into the Unknown bucket in serialize.h's contentBytesByLang[13] loop (harmless, additive,
// zero renumbering of any existing Lang value) — while `bytesPerTokenFor` (a linear scan, not an
// array index) still picks up its own kTokenCalib entry everywhere else. C is appended AFTER CSharp
// (L3) for the SAME reason again: index 15 clamps into the identical Unknown-bucket headroom, zero
// renumbering of Cpp..CSharp. `.h` stays C++-owned (ingest.cpp's kLangTable) — a C header parses
// acceptably under the C++ grammar and ownership of `.h` between C/C++/ObjC is inherently ambiguous
// without a project-config signal this tool doesn't have; graph.h's langCompatible bridges Cpp<->C
// (like the existing Cpp<->ObjC bridge) so a .c definition still resolves against its .h declaration.
// Toml is appended AFTER C for the SAME reason a FOURTH time: index 16 clamps into the identical
// Unknown-bucket headroom in serialize.h, zero renumbering of Cpp..C. Like Json it is a pure-data
// language — lang-incompatible with everything but itself, zero references, zero call edges.
// Yaml is appended AFTER Toml for the SAME reason a FIFTH time: index 17 clamps into the identical
// Unknown-bucket headroom in serialize.h, zero renumbering of Cpp..Toml. The third pure-data lane.
// Php (18) and Lua (19) are appended AFTER Yaml for the SAME reason a SIXTH and SEVENTH time: both
// clamp into the identical Unknown-bucket headroom in serialize.h, zero renumbering of Cpp..Yaml.

// JVM-bridged to Java via graph.h's langCompatible (mirroring the existing Cpp<->ObjC and Cpp<->C

// Call-site RECEIVER classification (P2-D one-hop type narrowing). Captured at ingest from the AST shape
// of `recv.method()` / `recv->method()` so resolve.h can narrow BEFORE the ambiguous §2a name spray:
//   None    — a bare call `f()` or a qualified `A::f()` (no receiver expr) → §2a ladder, unchanged.
//   ThisObj — receiver is `this` (C++) / `self` (Python): the enclosing class is definitive → Rule 1.
//   NamedVar— receiver is a plain local variable `x` (`x->m()` / `x.m()`): the var's TYPE pins the method
//             (Rule 2, one-hop return-type — captured here so the rule is a later drop-in; see resolve.h).
// The capture widens by EXACTLY ONE intermediate field hop because five guard sites key on
// `recv == RecvKind::None`, and a chained receiver classified `None` misread as a BARE name: Rule 1's
// bareCish arm wrong-narrowed `this->m_pool.run()` to the caller's own class, and shadow suppression
// deleted `this->m_cfg.enable()` under a local named `enable` (docs/EVALS.md §4 "Receiver-guard
// misfires"; gate test/chainguardcheck.sh). NO resolve rule consumes the two chain kinds yet — they
// exist so those guards stop misfiring, and they carry their names (`Reference::fieldName` below is
// free on a call ref) so a future chain-resolution rule needs no second re-parse:
//   FieldOfThis — `this->m_pool.run()` / `self.pool.acquire()`: base = the enclosing class,
//                 intermediate field = fieldName.
//   FieldOfVar  — `cfg.opts.enable()` / `m_cfg.opts.enable()`: base = recvVar, intermediate = fieldName.
// DEPTH IS PINNED AT ONE HOP, not opened toward N: a depth-3 chain still classifies `None` (its
// residual misfires are DISCLOSED — chainguardcheck arm (h) pins them as a recorded fact).
//   SuperObj — Phase 5 (docs/EVALS.md "Phase 5", kParserVer 77): Python `super().m()` / `super(C, self).m()`
//              — the receiver is the `call` node whose function is the identifier `super`. Before this kind
//              existed the site classified `None` and reached the ladder as a BARE call, so the S6-C prior
//              handed it to the caller's OWN class — the one class `super()` by definition skips. Resolves
//              through the enclosing class's BASES only (resolve.h Narrower::rule1BaseWalk); a miss is the
//              `@external` veto, never a spray. APPENDED so no persisted value renumbers (RawRef rides the
//              cache with recv as a u8). Python only: isMemberAccessNode classifies C++/Python receivers and

// extractor — the index is a FLOOR, disclosed as counts_floor= (src/graphlegend.h).
// Smallest int that fits (≤ 7 roles) → SoA-friendly. The role is ORTHOGONAL to the call graph: only
// Call refs become PageRank edges; Read/Write/Import/Extends/Type are recorded for the use-site index and
// NEVER enter the CSR (so the default ranked map is unchanged — G5).
//   Call    — the name is in function/callee position `f(...)` / `x.m(...)` (the existing call edges).
//   Read    — the name is referenced as a VALUE / operand (`y = x + 1`, `return foo`, `f(bar)` arg).
//   Write   — the name is the LHS of an assignment / a `++`/`--`/compound-assign target (`x = …`, `x++`).
//   Import  — the name appears in an import / #include / using directive (cross-module surface).
//   Extends — the name is a base class / implemented interface (derived → base; was `isInherit`).
//   Macro   — the macro-edges round: a call-SHAPED site whose name is an indexed C-family `#define`
//             (SymKind::Macro). NEVER emitted as role="call" — call-edge honesty: the site is an expansion,
//             not a plain call, and expansion semantics (stringize/paste/conditional arms) are unmodeled.
//             Unlike Read/Write/Import/Extends it DOES enter the call graph CSR (graph.h admits Call+Macro),
//             because the edge is the feature: the graph connects THROUGH the macro symbol. Ingest always
//             records the site as Call (a per-file parse cannot know another file's #defines); the retag to
//             Macro is the corpus-wide post-pass retagMacroCallReferences below, run at every ingest exit —
//             so a cached role=Call round-trips and is re-judged fresh each run.
//   Type    — the name is a bare TYPE mention: SYM named as a type in a signature, a declaration or a template
//             argument (`Widget makeOne( Widget in )`, `std::vector<Widget>`, `const Widget* p`). Joins the
//             NEVER-in-the-CSR list above — a type mention is a dependency, not a call, so it must not touch
//             PageRank or the default ranked map. Before this role existed a type-ONLY dependent was invisible
//             to the whole use-site index: `--uses=IngestResult` reported 0 against 438 real mentions across
//             68 files, so the most-depended-upon data structure in this repo read as a graph isolate.

// real signal here). libc++/libstdc++ std::string is 24 B (3 words); adjust N per-toolchain if it ever differs.
// `locals` (Phase 1 local-variable-indexing, docs/LOCALS_INDEXING.md) added as a uint32_t grouped with
// the other Q4 size-smell scalars, right before `loc`/`params`/`maxNest`/`arityExact` — measured (not
// assumed): sizeof(Symbol) is UNCHANGED at 48 + 2*sizeof(std::string). The scalar run before the two
// std::string members already carried 4 B of trailing alignment padding (std::string needs 8-B alignment
// on a 64-bit ABI); the new uint32_t landed in that padding for FREE — the best possible SoA outcome, not
// a coincidence worth losing: re-measure with a fresh `static_assert` fire (don't hand-arithmetic) if this
// ever needs to change again. `ppAlt` (uint16_t, ppalt disclosure) could NOT repeat the trick — `locals`
// had consumed the tail padding entirely (this assert fired 104 == 96 on that placement) — so it sits in
// the struct's one remaining hole instead, the 2 pad bytes between `lang` and `fileId` up top; sizeof
// unchanged, measured by this assert, not hand-arithmetic.
//
// `humps`/`deepLoc` (the nesting-depth profile) then cost the first real growth: 48 → 56 + 2*string,
// MEASURED with a standalone sizeof probe after this assert fired, not derived on paper. The step is
// unavoidable rather than sloppy — `locals` had spent the last of the trailing padding, so the scalar run
// ended exactly on an 8-B boundary, and Symbol's alignment is 8 (the std::string members), so ANY further
// field rounds the object up by a full 8 B no matter how small its type. Two uint16_t is therefore not a
// compromise but the whole point: it spends 4 B of that unavoidable 8 and leaves 4 B of live padding for
// the NEXT field to land in free, exactly as `locals` did. A smaller type here would buy nothing and cost
// range (both saturate at 65535 — see the fields' own comment); a uint32_t pair would have cost 16.
//
// `ev`/`evWhy` (essential complexity) then cost the second step: 56 -> 64 + 2*string, MEASURED with the
// standalone sizeof probe after this assert fired (the design predicted UNCHANGED because it budgeted the
// uint16_t alone; the eight evWhy tag counters are what force the step). The uint16_t ev spends 2 of the
// 4 B of live padding the humps/deepLoc step left; the 8×uint8_t evWhy run then crosses the 8-B boundary
// once (+8), landing with 2 B of live padding for the NEXT field. The alternative — packing evWhy into
// one uint32_t at 4 bits per tag — was rejected because a 4-bit counter saturates at 15, and printing
// "guard-return:15" for a function with 20 guard returns is a wrong count, not a floor (honesty rule #3);
// uint8_t saturating at 255 inherits humps' justification instead.

// body — the variable→type fact that lets resolve.h narrow a later `x.m()` / `x->m()` to `typeName::m`.
// Attributed to its enclosing definition (the function the binding lives in) by byte-span containment,
// exactly like a Reference, so the scope of a binding is the same scope a call's recvVar is looked up in.
// CONSERVATIVE: only an UNAMBIGUOUS binding narrows — buildGraph drops `(fromSymbol, var)` if the same var
// is bound to two DIFFERENT types in one scope (a reassignment to another type), so a wrong narrow is
// impossible. typeName is the WRITTEN type's final segment (`A::Foo` → `Foo`), matched against class names.
//
// L3 var→FUNCTION extension (fn-pointer/callback bindings): the SAME record shape also carries
// `var = &foo` / `H h = someFunc` / `cb = <lambda>` facts, discriminated by `kind`, so a later call-shaped
// `fn()` can resolve to the bound function. Rule 2's exact capture discipline and tombstone semantics apply:
// a var assigned two DIFFERENT functions in one scope resolves to NOTHING (buildGraph tombstones it), and a
// var with ANY fn binding never falls back to the bare-name ladder (the binding proves the call goes through
// the variable, so a same-named global function would be a FALSE edge). Two sentinels ride typeName:
//   kFnBindLambdaTarget  — the RHS was a lambda: the binding EXISTS (blocks the name ladder, participates in
//                          tombstoning) but resolves to nothing extra — the lambda body is already attributed
//                          to the enclosing function.
//   kFnBindClobberTarget — an assignment whose RHS is NOT a recognizable single function (`fn = getHandler()`,
//                          `fn = nullptr`): forces the tombstone, so a stale earlier binding can never win.

// ── LOCAL-SHADOW SUPPRESSION (r9 loss bucket 2; block-span fix round A5) ─────────────────────────────
// A reference site to name N inside the BLOCK where a LOCAL declaration binds N as a variable is a use of
// the LOCAL, not of any indexed symbol named N — C++ name lookup finds the local for that scope. The
// measured failure is real: a local `int run = 0;` put every `run` read/write inside its function into
// --uses=run (13 false sites on one r9 query), and a callable local could mint a false call edge through
// the bare-name ladder. SCOPE: each VarDecl record carries the byte span the declared name shadows within,
// and only a site whose own byte offset falls INSIDE that span is suppressed — so `{ int run = 0; } run();`
// keeps the genuine post-block call. Two span shapes, because C++ has two:
//   * an ordinary BLOCK declaration runs from its DECLARATION POINT — the end byte of the complete
//     declarator, which is [basic.scope.pdecl] exactly (immediately after the complete declarator and
//     before its initializer; for a structured binding, after its identifier-list) — to the end of the
//     enclosing compound_statement. Iteration 2 started this span at the block's opening BRACE instead,
//     which silently ate a genuine call written ABOVE the local (`key(); int key = 0;`): a recall loss,
//     not the disclosed over-suppression, so the point is now modelled rather than approximated.
//   * a WHOLE-SCOPE shape runs from the start of its scope, because its name is in scope there: a
//     definition's or lambda's parameters and a lambda's captures/init-captures (the body span), a catch
//     parameter (the handler span), a range-for variable (the loop statement), and a control-statement
//     HEADER declaration (that statement — `for (int run = 0; ...)` never reaches past its own loop).
// The residual over-approximation is the disclosed floor of emitShadowVarDecls, not of the span: a
// declarator shape it refuses (the most-vexing `std::string key( tok );`) records no evidence at all.
// Three further guards keep this suppression-only, never a mislabel:
//   * evidence is a VarDecl binding — a DECLARATION's variable name (ingest captureBindings). An
//     assignment-derived Type binding (`x = Foo();` re-binding a possibly-GLOBAL x) is NOT a declaration
//     in C++ and never suppresses.
//   * a (scope, name) that ALSO carries an L3 fn binding (FnDecl/FnAssign) is a call THROUGH the variable:
//     those references stay, so the resolve loop's binding resolution (and its tombstone honesty) is
//     untouched — `void (*cb)() = &run; cb();` keeps its reference and resolves via the binding.
//   * only a name some indexed symbol actually carries is suppressed: with no same-named definition
//     anywhere there is NO false attribution to prevent, and --uses on a plain local/parameter name (the
//     external-answer feature the writetarget gate pins) keeps its sites.
// Runs at every ingest exit AND after the multi-root merge (workspace.h), exactly like the macro retag
// above — a def named N in ANOTHER root only becomes visible to the collision gate once roots merge.
// Idempotent, deterministic (erase_if preserves order; hash maps never drive output order; span lists are
// built in ing.bindings' total order). Runs AFTER retagMacroCallReferences so a role="macro" site
// (preprocessor evidence, textually stronger than any local) is never touched.

// ONE declaring-block byte span. A 2-field POD and NOT `std::pair<uint32,uint32>`, because rw::svector
// requires a trivially-copyable element and a std::pair is not reliably one.
//
// THE PRECISE CLAIM, because the loose version of it is wrong in both directions. The standard does not
// REQUIRE std::pair to be trivially copyable, so the answer is implementation-defined: libc++ (this
// toolchain, 210106) says no, libstdc++ defaults the operators and says yes. Measured here, only the two
// ASSIGNMENT operators fail — both constructors and the destructor are trivial. Same portability class as
// infra/charconvcompat.h: a thing that happens to work on one standard library is not a thing you can build
// on.
//
// AND IT IS PERMANENT, so nobody should "fix" this back to a pair later expecting the library to have caught
// up. `pair::operator=` has to be hand-written to support REFERENCE members — `std::tie( a, b ) = f()` must
// assign THROUGH the references, and a defaulted operator would be deleted. More decisively, triviality is
// part of the ABI: a trivially-copyable type can be passed in registers and a non-trivially-copyable one
// goes by hidden reference, so making pair trivial would break every by-value pair parameter already
// compiled. libc++ ships in the macOS SDK under a hard ABI-stability commitment. `std::tuple` is the same
// story for the same reasons — treat it identically.
//
// The choice this drives, stated as a rule rather than a one-off: when a conversion candidate's element is a
// std:: composite that fails the trait, replace the ELEMENT with a named POD. Routing the structure to
// ankerl instead would forfeit the branch-free size() and the memcpy bulk moves over a library accident
// rather than a design reason; ankerl is for elements that are genuinely non-trivial (a real std::string, or
// a struct that owns something). The POD is byte-identical to the pair — 8 B, same field order — and

// spilled buckets still take + allocator per-block overhead) does not exceed what the plain
// std::vector<std::vector<NodeId>> costs today on EITHER corpus: ~75 KB vs ~80 KB here, ~276 KB vs ~265 KB
// there, where N=16 is ~100 KB and ~323 KB. p90 (18 here, 37 there) would have bought 3-9 more points of

// THE per-file symbol index every span- or line-based lookup starts from: bucket the symbol ids by file, then
// sort each bucket. `keep` selects which symbols enter it and `less` orders each bucket, because those two are
// the ONLY things that differ between callers — flipimpact.h wants every symbol in line order (the host of a
// `#if` region), ensemble.h wants only body-carrying functions in byte order (the owner of a lint finding's
// span). Both were written independently and a --quality-delta pass found them as a 159-token clone pair,
// correctly: same shape, different filter and key. Parameterizing exactly those two is what makes this ONE
// function rather than a family of near-copies, and it lives here because `IngestResult` does.
// Deterministic by construction: file buckets are indexed, never hashed, and `symbols[i].id == i` so the
// pre-sort sequence in every bucket is ascending id regardless of which caller built it.
//
// ON `less` AND TOTAL ORDERS. Four of the callers folded in here (atoms.h's OwnerIndex, search.h's grep
// index, and main.cpp's --lint dedup and --match/--lint index) compare bare `sigStartByte` with no
// tie-break, which is NOT a total order: two symbols sharing a start offset in one file may land either
// way, and std::sort is not stable. That predates this consolidation and is deliberately NOT changed here —
// giving them a tie-break would reorder ties and move emitted bytes, which a container change must not do.
// Every such sort is still deterministic run-to-run: same input sequence, same comparator, same std::sort.
