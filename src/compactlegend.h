// compactlegend.h — the --legend=compact dialect for EVERY XML verb (capture-audit 2026-09-04, lane L7, P1).
//
// WHY ONE LAYER AND NOT SIXTY EDITS. Lens 8 measured the bill: twelve verbs spend >80% of their bytes on the
// legend, the canonical ten-verb edit loop pays 29,824 B of legend per session for ~9 KB of rows, and the
// MCP server re-pays it on every call. --for/--grep/--slice grew a compact dialect by hand (each emitter
// branching on the posture); the other ~60 XML roots are printed by as many emitters. Compact is therefore
// applied HERE, once, to the finished document: the explanatory comments are replaced by ONE ≤400 B legend
// (schema id + the verb's purpose + a reading for every completeness attribute the document actually
// carries), the root gains schema="ripwire.<key>/v1", and every payload byte is untouched — rows, root
// attributes, CDATA bodies, and the comments that CARRY DATA (the map header's <!-- files= … -->, pack-task's
// <!-- body omitted … -->, the <!-- +more --> marker, --notes' counted header). The full dialect (the default,
// and --legend=full) never passes through this file.
//
// WHAT IS PROSE. A comment is explanatory prose iff it starts with one of kCompactProsePrefixes and none of
// kCompactDataPrefixes — the prefixes are the legend openers the emitters use (`<!-- ripwire <verb>: …`, the
// shared root=/at=/pr_iters=/metrics: blocks). Anything else is data and stays. A comment that already spells
// a `/v1:` schema id is a NATIVE compact legend (for/grep/slice emit their own) and is kept as-is; a root that
// already carries schema= is left alone entirely — the layer never double-compacts.
//
// THE COMPLETENESS VOCABULARY is emitted present-only: a term rides the legend iff the payload carries the
// attribute. The counts_floor reading keeps floormarkcheck's anchor ("is a FLOOR, never a total") verbatim —
// one attribute, one reading, in both dialects (lane L4's law).
//
// CONSUMERS: main.cpp (CLI — stdout is captured for the run and rewritten once), mcp.h (the textResult
// envelope, under the opt-in `legend:"compact"` argument). Gate: test/compactlegendcheck.sh (U)/(L)/(M).

// completeness term present. Roots shared by several verbs (`r` = the ranked map family, `ctx` = the bundle
// family) are disambiguated by a HINT the caller derives from its own flags (compactLegendHintFromRoot).
