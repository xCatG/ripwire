# maxfilesizecheck.sh — §P0.5d gate: --max-file-size must not silently shrink the corpus.
#
#   --max-file-size=8K  ->  files=463 of ~759, no skipped= anywhere       (before)
#
# The header presented the survivors as if they WERE the corpus: ~296 files vanished with nothing said,
# and every count downstream (symbols, edges, and every verb's totals) is scoped to a tree the reader
# was never told had been cut.
#
# Two invariants, and the second matters as much as the first:
#   1. when files ARE dropped for size, the header says so — skipped_oversize=N;
#   2. when nothing is dropped, the attribute is ABSENT, so a default run stays byte-identical (the
#      house rule: absent = nothing happened, and an unconditional new attribute would diff every
#      existing argvdiffcheck vector).
#

# i.e. the three >256 KB .json under bench/locbench/ vanished from the accounting the moment the generic
# ceiling stopped catching them first, with zero stderr — the exact class skipped_oversize exists to kill.
# files= itself does NOT move (the ceiling is a content-class guard and stays; symbols=/edges=/ambiguous=/
# unresolved= are byte-identical to the pre-fix binary), so this gate asserts the ACCOUNTING INVARIANT
# rather than a literal count: files= + skipped_oversize= is the same population at every setting.
# Derived, never hardcoded — a count in a gate rots (trap #12).
# The name is anchored on the space in front of it. `files=` is a SUFFIX of other header attributes
# (`macro_blanked_files=`, since the member-macro re-parse; `dep_files=`/`extent_suspect_files=` on
# other surfaces), and the greedy first match runs to the LAST one, so an unanchored second grep read
# `files=1773` AND the `files=7` inside `macro_blanked_files=7`, and $(( )) refused "1773\n7".

# 2026-09-09: the expectation is DERIVED from the tool's own --skipped rows, no longer assumed. The old form

# tree's SHAPE, not about the tool — and it expired the day docs/EVALS.md crossed 1,048,576 B (1M is
# 1024*1024, cli.h parseByteSize): every shard carrying this gate went red on a landing tip, and it read as a
# libstdc++-vs-libc++ split only because the macOS Release leg had been cancelled. Three arms replace it,
# each an invariant of the TOOL: (a) the JSON-lane rows at 1M are exactly the BIGJSON files; (b) every
# OTHER oversize row names a file that really is over 1,048,576 B on disk — a ceiling never drops a file
# under it; (c) the header's skipped_oversize= equals the rows itemized. A tree with no non-JSON file over
# 1 MiB passes (b) and (c) vacuously with OTHERROWS=0, which is the old arm's case, so nothing is weakened.
