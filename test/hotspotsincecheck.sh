# These two arms used to assert that --cochange / --rank-by=churn DEGRADE to all-history on a garbage
# --since (output byte-equal to the bare invocation). That was the surviving half of the very policy
# §P0.5c removed from --hotspots: an unresolvable value is not a request for the default window, and the
# only signal the caller got was a stderr note under an exit 0 root stamped window="18mo". --since is one
# GLOBAL flag; it now refuses ONCE, before any verb runs, for all four of its consumers. What survives
# from the old arms is the fact they were really protecting — that a digit-bearing garbage value
# (notaref9z) is never handed to git approxidate as a "date" — which a refusal states more plainly than a
# byte-comparison did.
# (--top-k rides only on the ranked-map arm; --cochange refuses it, which would mask the subject.)
