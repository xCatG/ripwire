# fixedbufsweep.sh — CA4 §B14: THE SWEEP. Every fixed `char[]` buffer whose contents can reach stdout as
# markup, classified, with a gate that fails when a NEW one appears.
#
# ══ WHY A SWEEP AND NOT A THIRD FIX ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# This class has now been fixed three times at the site that failed, and the RULE never became a sweep:
#   1. test/tracecheck.sh:246-249 records it verbatim for renderTraceBlock's `char row[640]` — fixed, gated,
#      and scoped to tracelocus.h ONLY.
#   2. test/churnjoincheck.sh:580-590 asserts the same idea on the INPUT side and greps src/gitmine.h ONLY,
#      leaving prcontext.h and quality.h outside both the grep and the claim.
#   3. §B14 then found SIX live emitters snprintf'ing already-escaped, unbounded path text into char[512].
# So this gate does not test a site. It re-derives the whole POPULATION from source every run and refuses to
# pass on a member it has never been told about.
#
# ══ THE RULE (stated once, in src/serialize.h above escapeXml — read it there) ═══════════════════════════
# Never snprintf ALREADY-ESCAPED or already-markup text into a fixed char[]. Compose it on std::string. The
# test that separates a breaching site from a safe one is WHICH SIDE OF THE BUFFER THE ESCAPER SITS ON:
#   escape-then-snprintf  -> the cut lands in the ESCAPED form (mid-entity, mid-attribute-name, mid-UTF-8,
#                            or before the element's own `/>`): a broken document at exit 0.
#   snprintf-then-escape  -> the cut only shortens PROSE, and the escaper runs over the shortened text.
# Length is not the danger; the escaping is. A char[512] breaks at 228 RAW bytes once `&` expands 5:1 and
# `'` 6:1 before the buffer is written.
#
# ══ THE ENUMERATION ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Method: balanced-paren extraction of every `snprintf(` in `git ls-files src/`, so a call broken across
# lines counts ONCE. Note the audit's "156 snprintf mentions / 37 %s-bearing calls" mixed two units — 156 is
# a LINE count (`git grep -c`) and the %s figure was a line count too; calls and lines are not the same
# population, which is why the gate reports all of them separately.
#
# NO CURRENT COUNT IS WRITTEN IN THIS COMMENT. The header used to carry "after the 8 conversions: 153
# mentions" while the gate PRINTED 154 — stale in the merge that landed it, which is the exact rot this file
# exists to prevent, committed by the file preventing it. The live figures are DERIVED and printed by the
# INFO line and PINNED by arm (S6); the only historical numbers kept here are the before-picture, which is
# history and cannot rot: 156 mentions / 146 calls / 36 %s-bearing lines before §B14's 8 conversions.
#
# CLASSIFICATION OF THE SURVIVORS: 0 breaching · everything else safe / latent / not-markup
# (see the TABLE below; every row carries its worst-case arithmetic). The two LATENT rows both sit outside
# the lane that wrote this gate and are carried forward, not fixed:
#   prcontext.h  tail[256]  248 B worst case -- SEVEN bytes of margin
#   serialize.h  hb[176]    ~160 B worst case -- acd/nccd are %.1f/%.2f on DOUBLES, formally unbounded
#
# THE 8 CONVERTED (6 breaching + 2 latent), and what each did at a 612-616 B corpus path:
#
#   #  site                                    buffer        BEFORE (base_w3)              AFTER
#   1  editcheck.h  <edit-check> head          char[512]     document REJECTED by xmllint  parses
#   2  editcheck.h  <c> caller row             char[512]     4 of 4 rows unterminated      0 of 4
#   3  packtask.h   buildD1Row <s>             char[512]     rows truncated + swallowed    0 of 3
#   4  packtask.h   renderNameOnlyRows <s>     char[512]     (same document, <far> tier)   0 of 3
#   5  packtask.h   <test> row (TWO unbounded  char[512]     document REJECTED             0 of 1
#                   interpolands: path+runner)
#   6  serialize.h  mermaid node line          char[512]     8 node lines collapsed to 1,  8 lines,
#                                                            each losing `"]` AND its \n   0 malformed
#   7  serialize.h  map header stats           char[480]     latent: 496 B worst case      composed
#   8  serialize.h  partAttr / rb              char[40]/[24] latent: 41 B / off-by-one      composed
#
#   Sites 1-5 breach G4 AT EXIT 0 — a caller cannot detect them. Site 6 never breached G4 (it lives inside
#   appendCdataSafe); it is the "well-formed but says something FALSE" member, and only a SHAPE assertion
#   sees it, which is why arm (S5) carries one. Site 7's cut deletes the trailing ` -->` and turns the
#   entire document into one unterminated comment.
#
#   Row counts are given as "n of m" only on the AFTER side by design: on the broken binary a truncated row
#   swallows its successors, so the document is one malformed blob and per-row counting is not meaningful.
#   The measurement that IS meaningful on both sides is the parse verdict, and it is in the table above.
#
# ══ ARMS ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#   (S1) POPULATION — every snprintf call in src/ that interpolates a STRING is a KNOWN row in the table
#        below. An unknown one FAILS: a new emitter must be classified, not merely written. "Interpolates a
#        string" means ANY string conversion — `%s`, `%.*s`, `%-20s`, `%.9s` — not the literal two characters
#        `%s`, which is what this arm matched for one round while src/ already used `%.*s` in an XML open tag.
#   (S2) NO STALE ROWS — a table row matching nothing FAILS too, so the table cannot rot into fiction the way
#        xmlCommentText's "all six echo sites" did (trap #12).
#   (S3) THE SIX CONVERTED SITES stay converted — the fixed emitters must not carry a fixed buffer again.
#   (S4) §B4 ANTI-ROT — serialize.h's `CALL-SITES: N` for xmlCommentText must equal the re-derived count.
#   (S5) LIVE — the six converted emitters, exercised at a ~600-byte corpus path, must be xmllint-clean.
#        A static gate proves the shape; this proves the fix. (test/det-gate.sh and test/xmlwellformed.sh
#        carry the same width fixture for the determinism and G4 halves — see §B15.)
#   (S6) THE COUNTS ARE ASSERTED — mentions / calls / string-interpolating sites / rows / width-form sites
#        are pinned next to the table and re-derived every run, so no figure in this file is printed without
#        being checked. The header's own count had already rotted by one before this arm existed.

#    classification. Re-derived from source 2026-07-30, AFTER §B14's six conversions.
#
#    breaching : an interpoland is already-escaped/already-markup AND unbounded. There must be none.
#    safe      : the cut can only shorten prose, or every interpoland is bounded by construction and the
#                buffer provably fits the widest format.
#    latent    : bounded by construction, but the margin is thin enough that a future edit can cross it.
#                Recorded, not fixed — each row says why, and what it costs when it goes.
#    not-markup: the result never reaches stdout as a document (a cache filename, a stderr diagnostic).
# NOTE on the count in each row (changed with the std::print conversion): it is the number of format calls
# into that buffer, ALL of them, not only the string-interpolating ones it used to be. "{}" is type-erased,
# so the narrower figure is no longer derivable from source. The PROSE in each row still describes the
# string-interpolating site(s) that earned the row -- that is what the hand analysis was about -- while the
# number is now the whole buffer's traffic, which is what (S2) can actually re-derive and hold you to.

# -- NUMERIC_ONLY -- the rest of the population, classified BY DERIVATION rather than by hand ------------
# Until the std::print conversion this gate could tell a string-interpolating call from a numeric one by
# reading the FORMAT: "%s" named the argument's type. std::format's "{}" does not -- it is type-erased, and
# no amount of reading the format recovers what used to be free. A detector built on the ARGUMENT text was
# tried and rejected: it found 6 of the 29 known rows.
#
# So the population is now the SUPERSET -- every fixed-buffer format call in src/, whatever it interpolates.
# That is stricter than before, and it matches this gate's own stated premise ("re-derives the whole
# POPULATION from source every run and refuses to pass on a member it has never been told about"), which the
# "%s" filter never quite honoured.
#
# The 29 rows in TABLE above keep their hand-written safety analysis. The rows below are the remainder, and
# their classification is DERIVED, not asserted: each carried NO string conversion in its pre-conversion
# printf format at 4c10be9d -- checked mechanically against that commit -- so none can be the
# escape-then-buffer shape this gate exists to catch. The conversion changed no argument and no buffer.
# Cross-check run at the same time: of the 29 string-interpolating rows, ZERO vanished in the conversion --
# every previously dangerous site still exists, with the same buffer and the same multiplicity.
#
# A NEW row here still fails the gate until someone adds it, which is the point. When you add one, say which
# set it belongs in and why: a string argument makes it a TABLE row, with real prose.

# ── THE POPULATION, and why it is not `"%s" in text` ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# It was, for one round, and the wave-3 verifier proved that blind: a WIDTH/PRECISION string conversion
# (`%.*s`, `%-20s`, `%.9s`) is a string interpoland and did not match. src/ already used that form in an XML
# OPEN TAG (packtask.h:134). The verifier injected a NEW char[512] emitter interpolating an already-escaped
# path into an XML attribute via `%.*s` — the exact §B14 defect — and this gate reported its counts
# UNCHANGED and ALL PASS. So the population is every STRING CONVERSION.
#   * scanned over the call's STRING LITERALS only, so a `n % size` in an ARGUMENT cannot masquerade as a
#     "% s" conversion (' ' is a legal printf flag, so the naive scan has that false positive);
#   * `%%` is consumed as its own token, so an escaped percent is never read as a conversion;
#   * `%.*s` and `%*s` consume TWO arguments — a precision/width int AND the pointer. That precision is NOT
#     a clamp when it is spelled `int( v.size() )`: it is just how a string_view is printed. A row's
#     arithmetic must bound the VIEW, never assume the `.*` bounds it.

# (S6) THE COUNTS ARE ASSERTED, not narrated. Until wave 3 this gate's own header carried "after the 8

# which is precisely the "count in a comment nobody re-derives" §B4 and this file exist to prevent. A number
# that is printed but not checked is the thing this round has now caught four times. So the numbers live
# HERE, in one place, and drifting one reds the gate with the new value already spelled out.
# RE-PIN 2026-07-30 (§B11.3, the edit-check fold disclosure). mentions 154 -> 155 and calls 136 -> 137: a
# CONSTANT +1 on both, which is the signature of a single fixed-size addition, and it is exactly that —
# `std::snprintf( defsAttr, sizeof( defsAttr ), " defs=\"%zu\"", … )` in editcheck.h. Re-derived from the
# diff rather than from the delta: the src/ diff adds two snprintf LINES and removes one, and the
# removed/added pair is the SAME `callersOpen` call with `incompatible="%zu"` appended to its format, so the
# net new CALL is one. editcheck.h itself goes 4 -> 5 mentions, which is that same one call. sites/rows are
# unmoved because the new call interpolates only %zu — it is not a string-interpolating site, so it neither
# joins the 30 nor needs a TABLE row, and (S1)/(S2) both stayed green across the change.
#            2026-09-08 (issue #66): +3 calls/+4 mentions over whatever main's base is (203/225 at the
#            2026-09-08 rebase onto 26abcc79 -> 206/229), sites and rows UNCHANGED — all three are in
#            src/graphlegend.h and were read before this pin moved: graphGaugeAttrXml and graphGaugeAttrJson
#            each gained a SECOND snprintf (the with-graph_unindexed= arm beside the without- arm; buf grew
#            96 -> 160 B, worst case ~119 B at three 20-digit size_t), and graphUnindexedTextClause is one new
#            snprintf into buf[256] (~198 B worst case). No %s in any of them, so none is a width form.
#            mentions is +3 for those and +1 more for the buf[256] site's own explanatory comment.
#            2026-09-09 (the printf-family -> std::print conversion): every pin moves, and all five move for
#            ONE reason -- the population definition changed, not the code. calls 206 -> 213 and mentions
#            229 -> 314 because the enumeration now matches rw::formatTo/formatToRuntime as well as snprintf
#            (mentions counts LINES, and the conversion added an emit.h include line to 64 files, which is
#            most of the +85). sites 42 -> 213 and rows 29 -> 92 because "{}" is type-erased: the format can
#            no longer say which calls interpolate a string, so the population is every fixed-buffer call
#            (see NUMERIC_ONLY above -- 63 of those 92 rows are derived from the pre-conversion format at
#            4c10be9d, not asserted). widthforms 3 -> 0 because a width/precision "form" was a printf
#            spelling (%.9s, %-11s); std::format spells the same thing as {:.9}/{:<11}, and the INFO arm
#            that counted them now has nothing to count. Re-derived, then read: of the 29 hand-classified
#            rows ZERO vanished in the conversion, so no dangerous site was lost -- only the cheap way of
#            spotting one was.
#            2026-09-09 (serialize.h REVERTED per the parity fence): -2 calls/-5 mentions/-1 row. Six labels
#            (flagless expand around connect pack_signatures pack_task) moved on the macOS CI legs and NOT on
#            Linux, all of them map-shaped and all sharing serialize.h's attribute buffers, so the converting
#            file was reverted rather than the manifest re-pinned — which is this gate family's rule and the
#            whole point of the fence. serialize.h is back on snprintf; its `p` row is a formatTo-only buffer
#            and goes with it.
#            2026-09-09 (the appendf clamps stop reading a would-have-written length): calls 211 -> 210,
#            mentions 309 -> 313, rows unchanged at 91. The three clamps now call std::format_to_n directly
#            and bound themselves by its OUT POINTER, so they are no longer rw::formatTo call sites; the
#            buffer they write through is `p` (two sites) and serialize.h's `qp` row leaves with them.
#            2026-09-09 (the amb=/lpin= cursor stops reading a would-have-written length): calls 210 -> 208,
#            mentions -> 311, rows 91 -> 89. That pair wrote amb= then lpin= AT THE OFFSET the first write
#            reported, so a count an implementation computed rather than wrote placed lpin= inside the
#            half-written amb=. It now cursors by std::format_to_n's out pointer, so `ambs` and
#            `ambs + ambLen` are no longer rw::formatTo call sites and their rows leave with them.
#            2026-09-09 (pageview's runtime format becomes two literals): calls 208 -> 211, mentions -> 314,
#            rows unchanged. pageDisclosure/pagingDisclosure each branched into an XML and a JSON call, so
#            the same buffer is now written from six sites rather than three. formatToRuntime is gone with
#            them: it was the only format in the tree not checked at compile time, and the only one that
#            could fail at runtime and return an empty buffer.
#            2026-09-11 (Kotlin nesting guard rows in --skipped, PR #126): calls 212 -> 214, mentions 315 -> 317,
#            sites 212 -> 214, rows 88 -> 90 — re-read, not re-counted. Both new calls are in verbs_report.h and both
#            are TABLE rows above: `nestAttr[48]` takes one integer count, and `clause[1024]` takes the compile-time
#            kMaxKotlinStringNestDepth into a fixed legend literal. Neither interpolates a path or a name.
#            2026-09-11 (tier-3 decline disclosure): +1 call/+1 mention/+1 site, rows/widthforms unmoved — re-read, not
#            re-counted: writeJsonMapHeader's `"declined":{},` formatTo into the EXISTING hdr[256], one size_t and no

Re-derived from the diff, not from the delta: one snprintf line became two, both into the SAME `char hdr[64]` (widened from 48 for the extra ` defs="%zu"`), and both interpolate only %zu — no %s, nothing escaped — so neither joins the string-interpolating population and sites/rows are unmoved.
