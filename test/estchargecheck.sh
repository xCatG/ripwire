# estchargecheck.sh — §H7 / §B13.4 / §B7.8 gate: EVERY emitted payload is CHARGED to est_tokens, the
# --token-budget gate actually stops it, --max-tokens' ceiling is disclosed in the currency it reports,
# and the withheld artifact uses the withheld_est_tokens vocabulary.
#
# THE BUG (§H7): serialize's est_tokens charged the MAP only. The
# --expand payload had been fixed once (serialize.h's own extraBodyTokens comment names the defect), but
# the un-named siblings — --metrics decoration, <sigs> (--pack-signatures), <src> (--pack-top-n) and
# <outline> — were never covered, so four different payloads reported the SAME number:
#     --top-k=10                  1435 B  est_tokens=507
#     --top-k=10 --metrics        2129 B  est_tokens=507   (~1.5x under)
#     --top-k=10 --pack-signatures 12850 B est_tokens=507  (~7.8x under)
#     --top-k=10 --pack-top-n=3   67143 B est_tokens=507   (~52x under)
#     --top-k=10 --outline=SYM     2668 B est_tokens=507   (~2x under; not even in the audit's table)
# and --token-budget — the CI stop — read that number, so `--pack-top-n=3 --token-budget=600` exited 0
# and streamed 67 KB (~26 900 tokens, ~45x the budget).
#
# THE FIX: est_tokens is computed from the ACTUAL EMITTED BYTES of the map's rows plus each payload
# section (measured through open_memstream, converted at the calibrated per-language / body rates), not
# from a per-verb formula. That is what #1 below tests, and it tests it as a PROPERTY rather than a pinned
# number: the implied byte rate (output bytes / reported est_tokens) must land inside the calibrated band.
# A new payload section added later and NOT charged pushes the rate straight out of band and reds this
# gate — that band is the recurrence guard, and it is the reason this file asserts a band and never a
# bit-exact token count (house rule: float/estimate assertions get a tolerance, never bit-equality).

# ── BUILD-FLAVOUR / DEGRADE-OBSERVABILITY PROBE (read by #14 below) ───────────────────────────────────
# CI runs the whole suite TWICE: once against a Release binary (catches optimizer-only bugs, e.g. the
# VERIFY-then-defend trap) and once against the plain build — Release defines NDEBUG, which compiles
# DEGRADED_PATH_ALERT out, so "if you add a degrade path, it is the PLAIN run that proves it" (CLAUDE.md).
# #14 asserts a DEGRADED_PATH_ALERT, so under the Release binary it is unobservable BY DESIGN and must
# SKIP with the reason named; under the plain binary it must assert. What it must never do is pass
# silently for lack of an alert it could not have seen — the 2026-07-27 CI trap this gate was written
# against. (Before 2026-08-01 it took the other branch and FAILED under NDEBUG, which is the same trap
# from the other side: it made the Release CI leg unconditionally red, so the leg could never be trusted.)
#
# Two INDEPENDENT readings, because either alone can lie:
#   (1) an unrelated, already-gated degrade path (--since=<not a date> → "[math degraded]"). If THAT one
#       is silent too, this binary compiles alerts out globally rather than #14's own seam having broken.
#   (2) --version's build-type token — versioncheck's source of truth, set by CMakeLists from
#       CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE ("dev" for the plain configure). Release/RelWithDebInfo/MinSizeRel define
#       NDEBUG; nothing else does.
# Only when BOTH agree — no alert observable anywhere AND an NDEBUG-defining flavour — is a skip honest.
# A binary that CLAIMS to be dev/asan yet observes no alerts is a real FAILURE, and so is one that can
# observe the unrelated alert but not #14's own.

#    --max-tokens with --token-budget (which --help invites) was comparing two different currencies with

#    for every N <= ~450 on src/, where the map's fixed floor (envelope + legend + the §B13.4 disclosure
#    clause itself) exceeds the ceiling with even ONE symbol emitted — 975 B against an 849 B cap at N=400,
#    15% over at rc=0 with empty stderr and the 849 printed inside the 975-byte document. Two consequences

#        LABELLED (the treatment --for/--pack-task/--recall already give the identical state), never silently
#        exceeded, and never silently "fixed" by loosening the cap.
#      * ME<=N likewise: once the floor is over the byte ceiling the document really does cost more than N
#        tokens, so reporting est_tokens>N is the truth and over_ceiling= is what makes it readable.
#    The small end is where fixed overhead dominates, which is exactly why it is swept: EVERY future byte

FOR_TASK="serialize the map"

# The --for lens spells est_tokens="N" QUOTED in its header comment, where the map spells it bare in its
# stats comment — and est_of() matches the bare form, so on --for it silently read nothing. Worse, a --detail
# bundle EMBEDS serialize.h's own comments as body text, which contain the literal `est_tokens=507` from
# §H7's bug repro: a document-wide grep returns 507 and every rate arm scores 146 B/tok against a number
# that came out of a quoted source file. So this extractor is HEADER-SCOPED (everything before the first
# payload element) and takes the quoted spelling. Trap worth keeping: on a verb that emits source text,
# grepping the whole document for your own marker reads your own source back at you.
# The payload-element list is a denylist and therefore incomplete by construction — a bundle that emits some
# OTHER element first (or none at all) falls back to `len(d)`, i.e. straight back into the trap. `-->` closes
# the header comment the attribute is spliced into (main.cpp inserts it at the header's own rfind(" -->")).
# W3-S item 5 (2026-08-19): --for's header can now legitimately hold TWO trailing comments — the main lens
# comment, then a second, standalone "<!-- root= is the crawl root ... -->" clause (forRootRelPathsLegendShort,
# main.cpp) appended after it closes, the same "second small comment after the first one closes" shape
# kRootRelPathsLegend already uses at eighteen OTHER call sites (e.g. --cochange's kCochangeRepoLegend +
# rootRelPathsLegend()). est_tokens is spliced into whichever comment is LAST (main.cpp's own
# `headerStr.rfind(" -->")`, exactly as this comment already said), so this extractor must find the LAST
# "-->" that precedes the payload boundary, not the FIRST — a plain `d.find(b'-->')` stopped scanning right
# after the FIRST comment closed and missed est_tokens sitting inside the second one entirely.

# ceiling ladder priced the document WITHOUT the root over_ceiling="1" (17 B) and the legend clause defining it
# (53 B), which runForLens splices on AFTER the ladder whenever est_tokens exceeds budget_tokens. est_tokens prices
# markup at 2.50 B/tok and the allowance is sized at 2.36 x 1.15 = 2.714 B/tok, so every bundle in that band
# carries 70 unpriced bytes, and one the ladder fitted within 70 B of the allowance is pushed past it with no rung
# fired. One budget on the live tree only sees that when the corpus lands a bundle in the 70 B window, so this arm
# builds its OWN git-less corpus in $TMP and runs it from a relative path (no at=, no churn, a fixed root=, nothing
# read from the live repo) and SWEEPS the budget in 10-token steps: the window recurs with every trimmed row

#     was a bracket note in the same comment, never an attribute: `--for … --token-budget=300` shipped 1,243
#     tokens at exit 0 with a bare <ctx>. SWEPT across the usable range like arm #5 (the small end is where the
#     fixed floor dominates): the root carries est_tokens=; delivered bytes sit inside the ladder's own
#     allowance (N x kMinBytesPerToken x kCeilingFirstEntryTolerance = N x 2.36 x 1.15, serialize.h) OR the
#     root says over_ceiling="1"; and a labelled root's est_tokens exceeds N (the label and the number agree).

#     the bundle is 3,485 B against a 4,342 B allowance — so the allowance arm PASSES — while the very same
#     root says budget_tokens="1600" est_tokens="1665" and withholds the one attribute that reconciles them.
#     over_ceiling= fired only on the ladder's LAST RUNG, so a bundle that overshoots by a little (the common
#     case) was silently unlabelled while one that overshoots by a lot was labelled. The property is about the
#     two NUMBERS the root itself prints, in the unit it prints them in: est_tokens <= N OR over_ceiling="1",
#     on EVERY rung. 1600/1700 are in the sweep because they are the rungs that were red.

# The MCP twin used to DECLARE est_tokens absent — `lens="churn,amp,tested,est_tokens"`, with a legend
# sentence saying "this bundle is capped by the server, not priced". Declaring an absence is honest about
# a hole; it is not an answer. The bundle is fully rendered in memory before it is returned, so it can be
# priced, and a client that gets no number cannot budget the call it just paid for (capture-audit
# merge-wave2 "found, not fixed" #2). Same property this whole gate asserts everywhere else: the reported
# est_tokens must PRICE the delivered document, checked as a byte-rate band, never as a pinned number.
#
# `legend` is passed only if the server accepts it (lane M is adding it in parallel): the arm must not
# depend on whichever legend dialect is the default on the day it runs, and must not fail on a server that
# has no such field yet.
