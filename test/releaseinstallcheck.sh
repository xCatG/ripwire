# ── (E) THE INSTALL ENDS READY, NOT WITH A MENU ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A new user ran one line and then faced four more: activate skills for Claude Code, or for Codex,
# then optionally hooks for either. "Installed" did not mean "your agent knows how to use it", and the
# README's headline (the same line "ships the task-shaped skills that teach your agent when to reach
# for it") leaned on the word ships. The installer now ACTIVATES the skills for each agent it can
# actually detect and prints one receipt line per agent. Three properties this arm pins:
#   * detection drives it — an agent that is not installed is never given a skills directory;
#   * hooks are NEVER activated automatically. They carry a data-capture disclosure the user must
#     read and accept, so they stay an explicit opt-in no matter how convenient auto-arming would be;
#   * RIPWIRE_NO_ACTIVATE=1 stages without activating, for scripted and image builds.
# The version-mismatch arm above deliberately leaves a 0.2.2 binary in the fixture. Restore a pristine
# 0.3.6 archive before driving the installer for real, or every arm below fails for that reason instead
# of the one it is testing.

# ── (F) THE UPGRADE PATH LEAVES A BINARY THAT RUNS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# (E6) above re-ran the installer over an existing prefix and called it "clean" on the strength of an
# exit code and a symlink. On 2026-09-06 that exact upgrade -- 0.3.8 to 0.4.0 into /opt/homebrew/bin on
# macOS 15 -- left a binary the kernel SIGKILLed on sight (exit 137, no output), and every one of
# (E6)'s assertions still passed: rc was 0 because the installer's own post-install version check was
# wrapped in `|| echo "version check failed"`, so it printed that phrase INSIDE a line that also said
# "installed", and exited 0. The arm fired, was true, and proved less than its name.
#
# The two properties that were missing are gated here. Note what these arms can and cannot see: the
# fixture's "binary" is a shell script, which has no Mach-O image and cannot reproduce the kill itself.
# So (F1) gates the REPORTING contract (a broken install must be a non-zero exit, not a cheerful line)
# and (F2)/(F3) gate the MECHANISM that replaced the overwrite. The kill itself was reproduced only on
# the real path, and the source comment records that its kernel-level cause is NOT established.

# (F1) A post-install binary that cannot report its version is an INSTALL FAILURE, not a footnote.
# The fixture binary succeeds the first time it is run (the pre-install version check at install.sh's
# archive step) and fails every time after, so the archive check passes and the POST-install check is
# the one under test. Without this arm, the installer can prove an install is broken and still exit 0.

# ── (G) A CPU BELOW THE x86-64 FLOOR IS NAMED, NEVER REPORTED AS A VERSION MISMATCH ────────────────────
# From 0.6.0 every non-native x86-64 build carries -march=x86-64-v3 (cmake/PortableFlags.cmake): AVX, AVX2,
# BMI1, BMI2, F16C, FMA, LZCNT, MOVBE. On an older CPU the prebuilt binary dies with SIGILL the first time it
# runs, and its first run is this installer's version check. That check was `--version 2>&1 | grep | head
# -1`: the pipeline took head's exit status, read an empty version, and told the user "refusing version
# mismatch" — true that something was wrong, false about what. Two layers are pinned here:
#   * AFTER the download, a verification run that dies or exits non-zero is a binary that COULD NOT RUN
#     (G1)-(G3); only a binary that ran and printed another version is a mismatch (G4);
#   * BEFORE the download, on x86_64, the CPU's flags are read and a CPU below v3 stops the install naming
#     what it lacks: Linux /proc/cpuinfo (G5), Intel-Mac sysctl (G9). On Linux that is EVERY processor's
#     flags record, since the binary can be scheduled on any of them: one below v3 stops it wherever it
#     sits in the file (G13, G14).
# The rest are controls, because a floor check that blocks a machine the binary runs on is worse than none:
# a v3 CPU installs (G6, G10), and so do processors whose records differ but each carry v3 (G15); unreadable
# flags never block (G1, G12); RIPWIRE_SKIP_CPU_CHECK=1 wins (G7); a pre-floor release installs on an old CPU
# (G8); Rosetta's translated bits are not judged (G11).
# Fixture flags use the names the platforms print: the kernel's arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h (LZCNT
# is "abm") and XNU's osfmk/i386/cpuid.c (AVX is "AVX1.0"; LZCNT sits in machdep.cpu.extfeatures).
