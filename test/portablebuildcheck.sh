# portablebuildcheck.sh — gate for L1 ( independence MUST-FIX #5): "Non-NATIVE build hardcodes
# -mcpu=apple-m1 -ffast-math — Linux/x86 fails out of the box".
#
# Exercises the REAL arch-flag-selection logic in cmake/PortableFlags.cmake — not a reimplementation —
# by include()-ing it into a tiny standalone CMakeLists.txt in a scratch dir. This is deliberately NOT a
# full `cmake -S . -B ...` configure of the real project: that would pay for all 15 FetchContent grammar
# clones just to inspect three compiler flags. PortableFlags.cmake only touches APPLE/CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
# and the two options, so a `project(x LANGUAGES NONE)` host is enough to drive it for real.
#
# Checks:
#   1) default (no flags) configure on THIS machine: if this machine really is Apple Silicon, the auto
#      -mcpu=apple-m1 branch must fire (proves auto-detect still gives Apple-Silicon devs today's behavior).
#   2) default configure + RIPWIRE_PRETEND_LINUX=ON (the test-only hook): must emit -O2 -ffast-math
#      -fno-finite-math-only and NOTHING Apple/host-specific (-mcpu=apple-m1 absent, -march=native absent).
#      This is the provable half of "Linux/x86-64/aarch64 must configure cleanly with no Apple flags" —
#      see the NOTE at the bottom for what this machine cannot prove.
#   3) RIPWIRE_NATIVE=ON: must emit -march=native (opt-in, unaffected by RIPWIRE_PRETEND_LINUX).
#   4) the real top-level CMakeLists.txt no longer hardcodes -mcpu=apple-m1 unconditionally (it must be
#      confined to the RIPWIRE_IS_APPLE_SILICON branch inside cmake/PortableFlags.cmake).
#   5) the real top-level CMakeLists.txt still routes through cmake/PortableFlags.cmake (didn't drift back
#      to an inline literal).
#   6) no ordered STL algorithm over std::string_view takes the default comparator in src/ — a line-local grep
#      (#6) plus a pass that resolves each container through its declaration (#6b), with planted controls.
#
# Usage: test/portablebuildcheck.sh
# Exits non-zero on any failure; prints PASS/FAIL per check, ALL PASS on success.

# ── #6: no ORDERED STL algorithm over std::string_view with the DEFAULT comparator, anywhere in src/ ──
# WHY THIS IS A PORTABILITY RULE AND NOT A STYLE ONE. libstdc++'s string_view three-way compare computes
# `n1 - n2` on size_type and lets it wrap (bits/string_view.h, _S_compare). That wrap is well-defined C++,
# but the G1 sanitizer stack runs -fsanitize=integer, which reports it, and -fno-sanitize-recover=all turns
# the report into an abort. libc++ (every macOS leg, including the macOS ASan leg) computes the same answer
# without the subtraction and never reports. So `std::binary_search( first, last, sv )` is green on this
# machine, green on the macOS sanitizer leg, and aborts EVERY ranked run on the Linux sanitizer leg.
# That is exactly what happened at 69a17f9: the external-name veto's two table lookups took main red with
# `unsigned integer overflow: 3 - 17` inside std::binary_search, on a repository whose own macOS battery
# and macOS ASan leg were both clean. The rule is therefore mechanical: pass an explicit byte-comparator.

# ── #6b: the same rule, resolved through each container's DECLARATION — the half the grep above cannot see ──
# #6 is line-local and type-blind: it fires only when `string_view` is spelled on the call line, and it never
# looked at std::sort at all. PR #135's extent detector sorted a std::vector<std::string_view> MEMBER declared
# 67 lines up and binary-searched a std::span<const std::string_view> PARAMETER (src/extentsuspect.h); neither
# call line names the type. #6 stayed green, both macOS legs stayed green, and on the Linux G1 leg every ingest
# of a C++ tree with two same-file class names that prefix one another aborted INSIDE ingest — before any verb
# ran, so even --pack-task's refusal arms died rc=134 with empty stderr (CI run 34583440115; the report,
# `unsigned integer overflow: 8 - 13` at libstdc++ string_view:576, came from resetExtentScratch's std::sort).
# The pass: every ordered algorithm called at its DEFAULT arity (no comparator argument) → the container its first
# argument ranges over (`x.begin()`, `std::begin( x )`, a ranges:: argument) → the NEAREST PRECEDING declaration
# of that name in the same file (a member access skips parameter-shaped ones). string_view anywhere in that
# declaration's template arguments (vector, span, array, a pair element) or a C array of string_view is a finding.
# static_assert calls are exempt: constant evaluation runs no sanitizer. Stated blind spots — zero findings means
# "none found", not "none exists": a container declared in ANOTHER file, an `auto`-typed container, and a
# comparator lambda that itself applies `<` to string_views. The two control scans run on planted input every
# time, so a scanner that goes quiet fails this arm instead of passing it.
