# ripwire — every verb, run for real

- **Date:** 2026-09-11 (regenerated capture; supersedes any older `docs/captures/COMMANDS_showcase_*.md`)
- **Lives in `docs/captures/`** — a directory the crawl/retrieval lenses SKIP (`kCrawlSkipDirs`, src/ingest.h): a generated doc that quotes every verb's output out-scores the source for any query about the tool and was measured at 77% of `--recall` on this repo when it sat at the root. `test/argvdiffcheck.sh` harvests its `## `-heading command lines as differential vectors — keep that format.
- **Version:** `ripwire 0.5.0 (dev, AppleClang 21.0.0.21000101, emit=std::print, built_from=9d2a809dd)`
- **Repo:** the ripwire repo @ `9d2a809d` — **CLEAN — `git status --porcelain` is empty**. The diff-aware verbs (`--situ`/`--test-gate`/`--quality-delta`/`--pr-context`/`--map-diff`/`--edit-check`) answer a question about the WORKING TREE, so that condition is part of their answer and every one of their captions below states which tree it recorded against. A clean tree is the honest default for a showcase, so they appear TWICE: once here on the clean tree (their empty/exit-0 shape) and once in the final section against a throwaway `git clone --local` sandbox carrying one deliberate regression, so their real gating shapes are visible without writing a byte into the read-only repo.
- **Corpus:** the ripwire repo itself (dogfood), via `./build/ripwire`
- **Sandbox diff** (the last section only): `.ripwire_notes        |  2 ++
 .ripwire_quality_acks |  1 +
 src/infra/sortutil.h  | 31 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++---
 3 files changed, 31 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)` — one preexisting function made deeply nested, one function's arity changed 1 -> 2, one copy-paste duplicate helper, one new 8-parameter public function.

**How to read the blocks:** ripwire's real XML output is minified — often ONE long line. For scanability, long minified lines are displayed re-wrapped with a line break at every tag seam (`><`). Header COMMENT lines (the legends) always appear in full — they are exempt from the per-line cut; any OTHER display line over 300 bytes is cut with a `… [line truncated: N more bytes]` marker, which can hit a long root element or row. `--plan-lanes` emits JSON and is re-wrapped at object seams the same way. Long outputs are cut to their first ~30 display lines with a `… [N more display lines; full output is M bytes]` marker giving the true size. Exit codes are recorded when non-zero; wall time when >1s.

**Not run (and why):** `ripwire <git-url>` (network clone), `--listen` / `--mcp-token` / `--allow-remote-edits` (the HTTP-server posture; `--mcp` itself IS captured in its own section as a one-shot stdio JSON-RPC exchange, and `wrap claude` shows the wiring), `--arch --baseline[-update]` (state writer against the read-only repo — `--note-add` / `--quality-baseline` / `--quality-ack` / the three edit verbs / `--edit-plan` ARE shown, inside the throwaway sandbox clone; `--index-out` / `--pin-census` write to scratch), `--eval-mined` (needs a `minedpair.jsonl` artifact from `bench/mine_traces.py`; none present in the tree), `--refetch` (git-url only), `--force` (wrap-only modifier), `--scan-skills` bare form (would sweep `~/.claude/skills`; the explicit-DIR form is shown instead), `--help` (185 lines — read it from the binary).

## `./build/ripwire . --exemplar="format byte sizes for humans"`

*The repo's best-in-class instance to imitate before writing new code (picked by ROLE).*

`````
<!-- ripwire exemplar for "format byte sizes for humans" (task -> kind=fn, low-confidence: weak match, fell back to fn): the repo's best-in-class fn to imitate — chosen by ROLE, NEVER by text similarity to your task: candidates are first filtered to cognitive complexity at or under the ccx ceiling (4x the complexity bar), then ordered non-fixture path before test-fixture path, tested before untested, higher fan-in, lower complexity, fewer lines, lowest id. low_confidence=1 marks a weak task-to-kind match that fell back to fn; over_ccx_bar=1 marks a corpus where nothing was under the ceiling, so the pick is the least bad rather than a clean one; candidates= counts the ELIGIBLE instances of the kind (post-ceiling), not every instance. On the root, the three attributes that ARE that ordering's evidence: in=reuse-count (callers), ccx=cognitive complexity, tested=1 when a test reaches it (OMITTED, never 0, when none does). The body follows in a bodies section, its callee signatures in a calls child; both disclose truncation the house way: total= is how many qualified, shown= how many are printed, capped=1 when the two differ (calls omits shown= and capped= when its list is complete). Copy its shape, not its text. -->

## The loop
1. **Zero-setup path:** just make your change, then run `ripwire <dir> --quality-delta --legend=compact`
   before you call it done — add `--legend=compact` every time you run this in a loop: on a CLEAN report the
   legend is nearly the whole payload (2,776 B to 454 B measured on a small fixture, 15,601 B to 8,775 B on
   a mid-change repo), the rows are byte-identical either way, and you have already read the dictionary — in a git repo it auto-compares the working tree vs `git HEAD` (`<quality-delta
   baseline="git-HEAD">` confirms it), no start-of-task action needed. **Tighter loop on a long change:** run
   `ripwire <dir> --quality-baseline` FIRST — **on a clean tree** — to pin an explicit floor (takes
   precedence over HEAD) so each edit deltas against the original start, not the last commit. On a tree that
   already differs from HEAD the pin **refuses**, naming the gating findings it would have swallowed into the
   floor: commit first, or pass `--allow-dirty` to pin anyway, which stamps the absorbed count so every later
   report carries `baseline_absorbed="N"` and a green exit beside it reads "clean *since the pin*".
2. **Make your change.**
3. **Measure the delta** — `ripwire <dir> --quality-delta --legend=compact` → only the regressions you
   introduced, across the
   10 kinds in the table below. Each emits `<r kind="…" sym=… was=… now=…>` (`members=` for duplication).
   Test-fixture dirs are exempt from `dead-code`; `short-horizon-churn` ignores your own current edit and
   exempts brand-new symbols/markdown/fixtures. Two exemptions are DISCLOSED on the report rather than
   silent, and both change how you read a zero: a symbol defined by a self-registering test/benchmark
   macro (doctest `TEST_CASE`, gtest `TEST`/`TEST_F`/`TEST_P`, Catch2, Google Benchmark, plus anything in
   `.ripwire_config`'s `register_macros`) is never `dead-code` — a static initializer is invisible to a
   name-based call graph — and the header's `register-macro-excluded="N"` counts how many were dropped
   that way, printed even at 0. …

#### Pattern: a directory of dumped tool output as a knowledge base

**Answers:** can `--recall` serve as a zero-setup knowledge base over dumped tool output — a
`git log`, an API response dump, a fetched doc, `<tool> --help` text — sitting in a scratch
directory, instead of a source repo?

Yes, unmodified. `--recall` never distinguishes "a codebase" from any other directory it can
walk: point it at the scratch dir and query it. No index to build, no daemon, no mutable store
between runs — the whole cost is one cold parse. Two conditions decide whether it works at all,
and both are yours, because the file you write is the only thing that sets them:

1. **Dump to `.md`.** `--recall` ranks DOCUMENT files: `.md`, plus the docparse'd
   `.ipynb`/`.html`/`.csv` (and Office/PDF through the optional markitdown bridge). `.txt`,
   `.log`, `.json` and extensionless files are **not** documents to it. A directory of those
   answers `0 relevant of 0 document files` and exits 0 — which reads like "nothing matched
   your terms" when what happened is "nothing was indexed at all". Redirect to `notes.md`,
   never `notes.txt`. The recorded run below is that rule's own demonstration: its scratch dir
   holds five dumps, and the header says `2 relevant of 2 document files` because only the two
   `.md` ones are documents — the `git log`, the `--help` text and the JSON access log are not
   in the population at all.

2. **Keep `##` headings in the dump.** A headed document is served as whole ranked SECTIONS, so
   an answer buried mid-file arrives at a small `--max-tokens`, and — while the served document
   SET stays fixed — a larger ceiling returns a strict superset of it; the `[sections: S of R
   selected (N in doc) … lines="…"; dropped_by_budget=D]` note names the ranges you actually got
   and what the ceiling cost. …

(capped: 1 of 2 relevant document files omitted — raise --max-tokens or narrow the query for 1 more (~2548-byte budget))

The rows are a WINDOW even without explicit paging: the default prints the 80 files with the best-ranked symbols (shown=/capped=/total=/has_more=/next_offset= disclose the cut) and next= pastes the next page; limit= raises it. pr_iters=pagerank-power-iterations(stop:L1-residual-below-tol,else-ceiling) pr_converged=0-only-when-ceiling-hit-first(absent=converged;no-such-attr=not-pagerank-ordered) -->

<!-- ripwire callers/callees: the 1-hop call hierarchy read off the call graph — the callers form lists symbols that CALL of=; the callees form lists symbols of= itself calls. of= is the selector you passed, defs= how many DEFINITIONS it resolved to (rows UNION every def's neighbours), count= the DISTINCT neighbour symbols (a floor, per counts_floor=), windowed by limit= and offset=. A neighbour that is an indexed function-like #define is a macro row (t="macro", role="macro" on the XML row): the edge crosses a macro expansion, not a plain call — rows carry no role= otherwise. Rows are ordered SOURCE first, then test/bench, then docs, by path within a tier. hop_tested=/hop_untested= partition count= by the tested= lens below (1-hop, never transitive). tested="1" on a row means an indexed test transitively reaches it (never 0, omitted when it does not). BLIND SPOT the test-gate legend also names: only a CALL EDGE from an INDEXED test symbol counts here, so a shell or CLI-level test running a built binary as a SUBPROCESS is invisible to it and a repo tested that way reads all-untested. Read untested= as no in-process test reaches it, not as no test covers it. next= is the one pasteable follow-up (the uses verb on this selector: the call sites). counts_floor="1" means every count here is a FLOOR, never a total: edges are extracted from source TEXT by NAME. Missing: dynamic dispatch (virtual/interface/duck-typed), a most-vexing-parse declaration with no call expression, a function-pointer/callback bound to more than one function in scope (reassigned, table-indexed, lambda-bound, or address-taken/reference-bound), and a plain-name binding (fp=handler) whose variable type is not PROVABLY a function pointer (a same-file typedef/declarator; a HEADER typedef is missed; auto/template types are read as unpinned, so KEPT). A macro-generated call site is role="macro" only when its name uniquely names an indexed function-like #define (C-family, t="macro"); a shared name stays a plain call, an unindexed macro is no edge. Read a zero as "none found", never as "none exists". graph_ambiguous=/graph_unresolved= are the whole graph's resolver gauge (calls split over several defs / calls whose in-repo defs were all language-filtered), the map header's ambiguous=/unresolved=. graph_unindexed=N is a third gauge: files no grammar could read (the map header's unindexed=), whose calls raise neither gauge above; absent when zero, and so is this sentence. COUNTING UNIT differs by verb: callers, callees, edit-check, graph-query and pr-context counts are DISTINCT SYMBOLS (repeated calls from one caller, and calls to two overloads, collapse into ONE row; multiplicity survives only in the call graph's edge weight). The reach counts (impact's reaches=, pr-context's dependents=) are the size of a transitive reach SET, each symbol counted once. The uses verb counts call SITES, one row per occurrence — a larger count there for the same symbol is these units agreeing, not disagreeing. The map header's edges= is a unit again different — distinct (caller,callee) PAIRS — and that document carries neither this marker nor this clause. -->

<!-- ripwire uses: STATICALLY RESOLVABLE use-sites of SYM (role=call|macro|read|write|import|extends|type; p=file:line) — a floor, see counts_floor below; that role list is the whole vocabulary. role="type" is a bare TYPE mention (a signature, declaration or template argument) with NO call edge — real but not an invocation, so it never reaches the call graph, PageRank or the ranked map; captured C/C++/ObjC only, and only a plain leaf spelling (a qualified or aliased spelling contributes no row). A base clause is role="extends", never role="type"; a type's own DEFINITION is never a use of itself. role="macro" is the call-shaped invocation of a name uniquely naming an indexed function-like #define — never role="call" (an expansion is not a plain call); a name shared with a non-macro definition stays role="call". Rows are ordered SOURCE first, then test/bench, then docs, by path within a tier.

Reference-name-based (same heuristic level as call edges) — verify in source if a name is overloaded. external="1" ⇒ SYM has no definition in the indexed tree under ANY spelling (stdlib/third-party) — never merely none in the file you qualified with (that spelling refuses instead). A "file:name" SYM narrows defs= AND the role="call" sites, which are kept only where the call RESOLVES to a chosen def (the callers verb's own narrowing, read the other way, so the two agree); read/write/import/extends carry no resolution and stay name-matched across every def sharing the name. narrowed_roles= names what narrowed, and defs_of_name=/call_sites_of_name= (file: qualifier only) are the un-narrowed totals. counts_floor="1" means every count here is a FLOOR, never a total: edges are extracted from source TEXT by NAME.

Call edges are name-based: dynamic dispatch / callbacks may hide connections. counts_floor="1": every graph-derived count here (nodes=, edges=, groups=) is a FLOOR, never a total; read a zero as "none found", never as "none exists". graph_ambiguous=/graph_unresolved= are the whole graph's resolver gauge (calls split over several defs / calls whose in-repo defs were all language-filtered), the map header's ambiguous=/unresolved=. defs= on a terminal row = that NAME has N definitions and the lowest-id one was used; qualify with file:name to pick another. Steiner rows never carry it. connects= on a Steiner row = how many DISTINCT symbols that intermediary joins (its callers plus its callees, the undirected view this search walks), so you can see how much the join actually explains; hub="1" says connects= is at or above hub_floor= on the root, and hub_floor= is DERIVED from this graph, not tuned: the smallest D with D(D-1)/2 > edges, the degree at which one node alone joins more distinct symbol pairs than the whole call graph has edges. Read a hub="1" join as "the only join found is a symbol that connects that many other things", never as a relationship. Equal-distance joins are resolved by the LOWER connects= (node id only breaks a remaining tie), so the answer does not depend on file order. max_tokens= is the token ceiling this bundle was SHAPED against (the max_tokens flag; absent = none was asked for); est_tokens= is what it cost, truncated="paths" says the shaping had to cut, and over_ceiling="1" says est_tokens exceeds max_tokens anyway (the trim ran out of things to drop before it reached the ceiling; the bundle is then complete, not further trimmed) -->

## `./build/ripwire . --impact=rankGraphTeleport`

*Transitive blast radius — everything that reaches SYM. NOW carries shown/capped.*

`````
<!-- ripwire impact: transitive blast radius — symbols that reach SYM via calls (review before changing SYM). next= is the one pasteable follow-up (the safe-delete read of SYM). raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it); on the root, limit="0" means no explicit limit was given and the verb's own default page size shaped the window — never a zero-row page. importers= is a SECOND, weaker reach: the files that directly include/import a file defining SYM, as <f via="import" p="…" lazy="0|1"/> rows after the symbol rows — not call reach, never added to reaches= (different units, files vs symbols; an importer may use a different symbol from that file, or none at all). DIRECT (one hop), never the transitive include cone. lazy="1" means every one of that importer's edges into SYM's file is written INSIDE A CLOSURE (a TS/JS require()/import() in a function body, a Ruby constant receiver in a method/lambda/block, a Ruby autoload), firing only if and when it runs; lazy="0" means at least one edge is load-time. shown_importers=/importers_capped= disclose that listing's own truncation (importers= stays the full count); limit=/offset= window the symbol rows only. tested="1" on a row means an indexed test transitively reaches it (never 0, omitted when it does not). radius_tested=/radius_untested= partition reaches= by that same lens (transitive, unlike callers/callees). BLIND SPOT the test-gate legend also names: only a CALL EDGE from an INDEXED test symbol counts here, so a shell or CLI-level test running a built binary as a SUBPROCESS is invisible to it and a repo tested that way reads all-untested. Read untested= as no in-process test reaches it, not as no test covers it. counts_floor="1" means every count here is a FLOOR, never a total: edges are extracted from source TEXT by NAME. Missing: dynamic dispatch (virtual/interface/duck-typed), a most-vexing-parse declaration with no call expression, a function-pointer/callback bound to more than one function in scope (reassigned, table-indexed, lambda-bound, or address-taken/reference-bound), and a plain-name binding (fp=handler) whose variable type is not PROVABLY a function pointer (a same-file typedef/declarator; a HEADER typedef is missed; auto/template types are read as unpinned, so KEPT). A macro-generated call site is role="macro" only when its name uniquely names an indexed function-like #define (C-family, t="macro"); a shared name stays a plain call, an unindexed macro is no edge. Read a zero as "none found", never as "none exists". graph_ambiguous=/graph_unresolved= are the whole graph's resolver gauge (calls split over several defs / calls whose in-repo defs were all language-filtered), the map header's ambiguous=/unresolved=. graph_unindexed=N is a third gauge: files no grammar could read (the map header's unindexed=), whose calls raise neither gauge above; absent when zero, and so is this sentence. COUNTING UNIT differs by verb: callers, callees, edit-check, graph-query and pr-context counts are DISTINCT SYMBOLS (repeated calls from one caller, and calls to two overloads, collapse into ONE row; multiplicity survives only in the call graph's edge weight). The reach counts (impact's reaches=, pr-context's dependents=) are the size of a transitive reach SET, each symbol counted once. The uses verb counts call SITES, one row per occurrence — a larger count there for the same symbol is these units agreeing, not disagreeing. The map header's edges= is a unit again different — distinct (caller,callee) PAIRS — and that document carries neither this marker nor this clause. pr_iters=pagerank-power-iterations(stop:L1-residual-below-tol,else-ceiling) pr_converged=0-only-when-ceiling-hit-first(absent=converged;no-such-attr=not-pagerank-ordered) -->

SPAN TIERS: each hit is classified by the tree-sitter span it sits in (code/comment/string) and this answer serves the CODE tier, or — when no hit is code — comment and string TOGETHER; tier= names what was served when it is not code, so a pattern living only in prose is answered, never emptied. tier_partial= (value 1, present only then) qualifies that label: it was elected over the CLASSIFIED hits ALONE while tier_unclassified= hits were never classified, so read it as the tightest tier PROVEN present, never as proof that no hit is code. Nothing past the budget is suppressed, so the partiality narrows what the LABEL may be read to mean, never which rows you got; its absence beside a tier= means the label is a fact. suppressed_comment=/suppressed_string= are the classified hits held back: not in hits=, and the reason complete= cannot appear. Pass grep-in=any (dashes omitted) for every tier. Hit files are parsed on demand under a fixed budget: tier_parsed= how many were classified, tier_budget= which ceiling stopped it (files or bytes, present only then — and the root then also carries counts_floor="1": the tier counts are floors while hits= stays exact and every row is served), tier_unclassified= hits in files nothing classified — always EMITTED, never suppressed. A byte-identical match at OTHER sites in the SAME file folds into the first <hit>'s n= (default 1, unset) and an at-tagged sibling element (l=/in=, self-closing) per extra site — never on a paged or grep-context/-before/-after answer (dashes omitted, illegal in an XML comment), where every site keeps its own <hit>. After the hit rows, <enc> rows list each DISTINCT enclosing symbol NAME of THIS page (first-appearance order, bounded by the page) with callers= its 1-hop DISTINCT-caller count, unioned across same-named defs like the callers verb (a FLOOR — dynamic dispatch contributes no edge), defs= how many defs the name grouped (only when more than one), cx= complexity; amp=/tested= join only when a metrics co-run already computed that lens. On a zero-hit answer a <suggest> element may follow: SUGGESTIONS, never matches — near= the nearest indexed symbol name (did-you-mean), next= a ready-to-paste conceptual fallback; absent for regex/non-word-like patterns or when nothing plausible exists. COMPLETENESS: complete= on the root (value 1) means this listing is EXHAUSTIVE and a consumer need not re-derive it: a LITERAL scan read every indexed file end to end, hit no collection ceiling, and printed every hit it found — so on this answer a zero really is zero and a hit absent above is absent from every indexed file. The claim is complete-within-the-index ONLY: most files the ingest skipped were never scanned (the skipped verb lists exactly which, with reasons; the ONE exception is the unindexed_files_scanned= class right below, itself never covered by complete=), and files outside the indexed roots are outside the claim. The largest single subtraction is named on the root itself: corpus_pruned_dirs= below counts the subtrees the built-in crawl denylist removed WHOLE, so read this claim as exhaustive over what was indexed, never over what is on disk. It never appears on a regex answer (the prefilter is a performance switch that may not change the answer, so neither mode claims), a capped or paged listing, or a scan that could not read a file; its ABSENCE claims nothing. The enc rows' caller counts stay FLOORS regardless — complete= speaks for the hit rows alone. unindexed_files_scanned= counts files outside the index (unsupported-ext, but text-looking — the skipped verb's own unsupported-ext class) that THIS answer additionally scanned for the same pattern; their hits print inside a trailing unindexed element (present only when it found something), holding its own <f> rows in the same shape as above, and never carry in= — there is no symbol table to check for such a file, which is not the same claim as file scope. THE TWO POPULATIONS: every count above — files, hits, shown, capped, total, complete — is the IN-INDEX search ALONE. unindexed_hits= sizes the second one, always stated (a zero included); the trailing unindexed element carries that same number as its own count= beside shown=/capped= and obeys the SAME window limit/offset set here (dashes omitted), so a one-row page is one row on BOTH lists and a page past its end is empty, not repeated. unindexed_files_skipped= (present only when nonzero) counts candidates this scan saw but did not read: over the max-file-size ceiling, sniffed binary, or unreadable. unindexed_candidates_capped="1" (present only when true) means the CANDIDATE list itself (the skipped verb's own 500-row-per-class cap) was already a floor, so files past it were never considered here either — see the skipped verb for every row. corpus_excluded= counts files a caller's own exclude filter kept OUT of the index entirely; corpus_oversize= counts files the crawl SAW but dropped for exceeding the size ceiling; corpus_pruned_dirs= counts the DIRECTORIES the BUILT-IN crawl denylist pruned whole — vendor, third_party, build, dist, out, target, node_modules and the rest — a directory count and not a file count, because files beneath a pruned subtree are never stat'd and so were never counted. All three answer what an otherwise-empty answer alone cannot: not in this repo, or in a file that was never scanned — the skipped verb itemizes the rows behind the first two and reports the third as its own pruned_dirs=. next= is the one pasteable follow-up: the at verb on the top hit; the next page (compact legend) when cut; the conceptual lens on a zero-hit answer. raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it); on the root, limit="0" means no explicit limit was given and the verb's own default page size shaped the window — never a zero-row page -->

A byte-identical match at OTHER sites in the SAME file folds into the first <hit>'s n= (default 1, unset) and an at-tagged sibling element (l=/in=, self-closing) per extra site — never on a paged or grep-context/-before/-after answer (dashes omitted, illegal in an XML comment), where every site keeps its own <hit>. After the hit rows, <enc> rows list each DISTINCT enclosing symbol NAME of THIS page (first-appearance order, bounded by the page) with callers= its 1-hop DISTINCT-caller count, unioned across same-named defs like the callers verb (a FLOOR — dynamic dispatch contributes no edge), defs= how many defs the name grouped (only when more than one), cx= complexity; amp=/tested= join only when a metrics co-run already computed that lens. On a zero-hit answer a <suggest> element may follow: SUGGESTIONS, never matches — near= the nearest indexed symbol name (did-you-mean), next= a ready-to-paste conceptual fallback; absent for regex/non-word-like patterns or when nothing plausible exists. COMPLETENESS: complete= on the root (value 1) means this listing is EXHAUSTIVE and a consumer need not re-derive it: a LITERAL scan read every indexed file end to end, hit no collection ceiling, and printed every hit it found — so on this answer a zero really is zero and a hit absent above is absent from every indexed file. The claim is complete-within-the-index ONLY: most files the ingest skipped were never scanned (the skipped verb lists exactly which, with reasons; the ONE exception is the unindexed_files_scanned= class right below, itself never covered by complete=), and files outside the indexed roots are outside the claim. The largest single subtraction is named on the root itself: corpus_pruned_dirs= below counts the subtrees the built-in crawl denylist removed WHOLE, so read this claim as exhaustive over what was indexed, never over what is on disk. It never appears on a regex answer (the prefilter is a performance switch that may not change the answer, so neither mode claims), a capped or paged listing, or a scan that could not read a file; its ABSENCE claims nothing. The enc rows' caller counts stay FLOORS regardless — complete= speaks for the hit rows alone. unindexed_files_scanned= counts files outside the index (unsupported-ext, but text-looking — the skipped verb's own unsupported-ext class) that THIS answer additionally scanned for the same pattern; their hits print inside a trailing unindexed element (present only when it found something), holding its own <f> rows in the same shape as above, and never carry in= — there is no symbol table to check for such a file, which is not the same claim as file scope. THE TWO POPULATIONS: every count above — files, hits, shown, capped, total, complete — is the IN-INDEX search ALONE. unindexed_hits= sizes the second one, always stated (a zero included); the trailing unindexed element carries that same number as its own count= beside shown=/capped= and obeys the SAME window limit/offset set here (dashes omitted), so a one-row page is one row on BOTH lists and a page past its end is empty, not repeated. unindexed_files_skipped= (present only when nonzero) counts candidates this scan saw but did not read: over the max-file-size ceiling, sniffed binary, or unreadable. unindexed_candidates_capped="1" (present only when true) means the CANDIDATE list itself (the skipped verb's own 500-row-per-class cap) was already a floor, so files past it were never considered here either — see the skipped verb for every row. corpus_excluded= counts files a caller's own exclude filter kept OUT of the index entirely; corpus_oversize= counts files the crawl SAW but dropped for exceeding the size ceiling; corpus_pruned_dirs= counts the DIRECTORIES the BUILT-IN crawl denylist pruned whole — vendor, third_party, build, dist, out, target, node_modules and the rest — a directory count and not a file count, because files beneath a pruned subtree are never stat'd and so were never counted. All three answer what an otherwise-empty answer alone cannot: not in this repo, or in a file that was never scanned — the skipped verb itemizes the rows behind the first two and reports the third as its own pruned_dirs=. next= is the one pasteable follow-up: the at verb on the top hit; the next page (compact legend) when cut; the conceptual lens on a zero-hit answer. raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it); on the root, limit="0" means no explicit limit was given and the verb's own default page size shaped the window — never a zero-row page -->

## `./build/ripwire . --pack-signatures --top-k=10`

*Body-elided decl skeletons — recounted on this corpus. Measured as element bytes: the <d> signature+doc elements --pack-signatures emits, against the SAME symbols' full <b> bodies from --expand, with the CORPUS-ROOT PREFIX SUBTRACTED FROM BOTH SIDES. That subtraction is the whole methodology and the figure is meaningless without it: the root repeats inside every element's id= and p=, it is not what this verb elides, and counting it makes the headline a function of how deep the checkout happens to sit on disk — on one corpus, three spellings of the same root read 18.6 points apart before the subtraction and agree exactly after it. Root-neutralised on THIS repo: 89.5% fewer bytes at top-10, 81.8% at top-50, 84.3% at top-100 (re-derived 2026-09-10 at the sibs= cap raise: kMaxExpandSibs went 8 -> 100, so --expand's <b> bodies now carry the file context the old cap hid — 89.3% of all sibling names — and the body side is this ratio's DENOMINATOR, so the figure rises without --pack-signatures eliding anything new. Measured on a fixed tree with the top-50 membership and the signature side unchanged: top-50 from 71.0. A real re-derivation of a corpus that changed, not a tolerance edit; previously re-derived 2026-09-09 at the printf-family -> std::print conversion: converting ~1,500 emitter call sites to rw::emitTo/emitRaw/formatTo across 93 files changes how large the ranked symbols' BODIES are, and the body side is this ratio's denominator — top-50 from 72.3. A real re-derivation of a corpus that changed, not a tolerance edit; previously re-derived 2026-09-08 at the confident-zero round, issues #62/#63/#66: that change adds symbols to src/graphlegend.h and the new src/preprocdead.h and re-homes two long comment blocks from call sites onto the helpers they explain, which moves both WHICH symbols the ranked top-50 holds and how large their bodies are — top-50 from 74.0. A real re-derivation of a corpus that changed, not a tolerance edit; previously re-derived 2026-09-06 at the stranger-audit fix round: the doctor, cache-sweep and html-provenance bodies grew this corpus's BODY side, moving top-50 from 75.6 — a real re-derivation, not a tolerance edit; before that, re-derived 2026-09-05 at the capture-audit close: lane L7's P16 caps --expand's sibs= at 8 names, which SHRINKS the body side of this ratio and moved the figure down from 84.5/80.2/80.6 — the V1 2026-08-15 re-center, when sibs=/inc= first grew the body side from 70.0/61.0/63.8, in reverse; both were real re-derivations, not tolerance edits). top-50 is the number to quote, because the sigs payload is top-50 regardless of --top-k and is therefore what THIS command emits. A single small/trivial body can still invert it (signature+doc bigger than the body), like the --format=columnar sibling below. test/showcasecapturecheck.sh (C) re-derives all three from this repo every run, in the same quantity, and fails if the caption and the recount drift apart.*

// svector.h — rw::svector: a small-vector with N INLINE slots that spills to the heap only past N.
// 16 bytes at <uint32,2>, with a BRANCH-FREE size(). Both, not one or the other.
//
// ── THE DESIGN, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The shape the host tree leans on hardest is `Map<K, svector<V,N>>` — many tiny id-lists (byName /
// canonByName / shard maps, and ~100 more structures after the conversion wave): WRITE-ONCE during the
// parse/merge, then READ-HOT during resolve.
//
// Three things matter for that shape, and the layout below gets all three:
//   • no per-list malloc — the N small lists that would each allocate are inline;
//   • a BRANCH-FREE size() — `return sz_`, because the size lives in its own field;
//   • 16 BYTES per instance — because `inl_` and `heap_` are never both live, so they share storage.
//
// The union is the whole trick. The previous revision of this file paid 8 extra bytes (24 B) for the
// explicit size field, on the reasoning that a branch-free size() was worth it. That was a false
// choice: union the inline array with the heap pointer and the struct reaches 16 B — ankerl's size —
// while the size stays in its own field and size() stays branch-free.
//
// THE TRADE THAT REMAINS, stated honestly. At 16 bytes you can have:
//   • ankerl::svector's 3 inline slots, with a size() that branches on is_direct() (and, once spilled,
//     dereferences into the heap block to read the size — a dependent load, not just a branch); or
//   • this type's 2 inline slots, with size() branch-free.
// The measurement chose the second. See bench/SVECTORAB.md; the short version is below.
//
// ── WHAT THE MEASUREMENT ACTUALLY SAID (bench/SVECTORAB.md, hardware counters + working-set sweep) ────
// At 200 000 distinct names the profile is memory-bound (IPC 0.70, L1D-MPKI 225, LLC-MPKI 84.9) and this
// layout beats the old 24-byte one by 11.7% on the size-hot loop — 39x that column's 0.3% noise floor.
// Two mechanisms, separable because this type differs from the old one ONLY in size and from ankerl ONLY

Treat it as an upper bound on quietness, not a measure of it. raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it) -->

*Token-normalized duplicate bodies.*

`````
<!-- ripwire clones: function bodies with similar normalized token streams (identifiers/literals normalized, so renamed copies match). type=2 exact/renamed (Type-1/2); type=3 gapped near-miss (an inserted/changed statement, similarity in [0.80,1.0)). Reuse don't reimplement; a fix to one likely belongs in all. groups= and type3= are the two GROUP-TYPE totals (each capped independently, so neither is the row count); total= is the true row total (groups + type3-group-count) and is ALWAYS present, paged or not; shown= is the number of group rows that follow this run. capped="1" means rows were dropped. exempt= on a group ⇒ every member is on a path the quality-delta verb's duplication kind deliberately ignores (fixture dirs / shell test-runners repeat boilerplate by convention) — a fact here, never a gate there; exempt_groups= counts them over ALL groups. idiom= on a group names the RECOGNIZED SHAPE every one of its members classifies to, from a CLOSED set of three: threshold-ladder (a chain of if-compare-return and nothing else), switch-name-table (a switch whose every arm is a label plus a literal return), builder-chain (a param-struct initializer chain). demoted="1" additionally means the quality-delta verb's duplication kind reports this group as minor rather than gating on it, which happens only when the WHOLE conjunction holds: every member the same recognized idiom, no two members sharing a single non-keyword identifier, no two members sharing an enclosing context (file plus scope), and the group under 80 normalized tokens. Five cross-domain bucketing ladders that share only the idiom are noise; two ladders over the same enum, or two in one namespace, are a copy. The idiom name is printed precisely so a human can overrule the demotion by reading the members: a demoted row is annotated, never removed. idiom_groups= and demoted_groups= count each of those over ALL groups. FLOOR on the classifier, since a silence here would read as coverage: the shape is read off the body's TOKEN stream and not a parse tree, so a macro-assembled body classifies as whatever its raw tokens spell; the table arm models case-labelled switches only; and builder-chain models the field-assignment spelling, not the fluent chained-call one. gid= on a row is its CLONE COMPONENT: the Type-3 pass reports PAIRS, so three functions that are all near-copies of each other arrive as three rows of two; rows sharing a gid are one cluster, and clone_groups= counts the clusters (union-find over the pair graph, over ALL detected rows, not just the shown ones). dup_pct=duplicated-LOC/total-LOC as a percentage, where duplicated-LOC sums, per cluster, every member's loc EXCEPT the largest member's (one instance is the code you keep, the rest is the redundancy — so a 3-clone cluster counts its lines TWICE) and total-LOC is every function/method body the detector considered; dup_loc= and total_loc= are those two operands. counts_floor="1": the Type-3 pair list is capped upstream, so a dropped pair is a cluster left unmerged — clone_groups/dup_loc/dup_pct are floors, never totals. raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it). -->

*Files that change together in git (hidden coupling).*

`````
<!-- ripwire cochange: file pairs that change together in git but share no transitive static dependency (surprising=1) = hidden coupling. together= is the number of commits in window= that touched BOTH files (3 or more, or the pair is not reported); deg= is that count over the commit count of the LESS-CHANGED of the two files, so 1.00 means the quieter file never changed without the other. conf_ab= is that same fraction over a='s OWN commit count and conf_ba= over b='s, which is the asymmetric form: conf_ab=1.00 means a never changed without b. deg= is by construction the larger of the two, and driver= names which side it came from ("a" or "b") — the file whose changes most reliably imply the other's, and therefore the one to look at first. driver= is OMITTED when the two directions are equal, because a tie is not a finding. recur= is how many of sub_windows= the pair actually co-changed in: the mined window is cut into that many equal-COMMIT-COUNT slices (not equal time — a calendar slice can hold 400 commits or 4), so recur=1 at any together= is one burst of activity and not a persistent coupling, which is the distinction a single window cannot make. sub_windows= is the denominator and is never omitted; it is smaller than the nominal 3 only when the window holds fewer commits than that. min_recur= appears when cochange-recur=K (the flag) filtered the rows, so a short list is explained rather than silent. window= is the mining window: the default 18 months, or the since=REV|DATE value when one resolved. surprising= is only defined where BOTH sides could carry a static dependency at all, and that is a PAIR question, not a per-file one: both sides must be dependency-capable (the set deps <health dep_langs=> names) AND resolve in the SAME dialect, because a shell script cannot source a C++ translation unit and an #include cannot name a shell script. md, json, toml, yaml and binary/unknown files are capable of nothing; sh, rb, lua and ex became capable at parser version 81 and each answers only its own kind. A pair that fails either half keeps its row and carries dep_capable=0 instead, because for it "shares no static dependency" is vacuously true rather than evidence. raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it) -->

On a level-0 module size= is its true member count and shown=/capped= describe the member list printed here, which is fixed at the 5 top-ranked members and is not widened by limit=/offset= (those page the TOP-LEVEL modules); the community drill verb pages one module's full member list by its level-0 id. A module above level 0 lists every child module, so it carries no shown=/capped= pair. levels_shown= is how many of the levels= this document prints from the top (default 2; the zoom-levels flag sets it, 0 = all): a module AT the cut carries children= (its child modules, none printed) instead of nesting.

## `./build/ripwire . --quality-delta`

*On a CLEAN tree: nothing got worse, exit 0. The gating shape is in the sandbox section below.*

**wall time: 4.88s**

`````
<!-- ripwire quality-delta: only what a change made WORSE against the floor baseline= names below. Descriptive: weigh and fix the real ones, do not game the number (a wrong abstraction beats a low score). TEN KINDS, and kind= on every row names which one: complexity over the ccx bar, verbosity (LOC), nesting, params, duplication, dead-code, api-surface (new public contract drift), error-masking, short-horizon-churn, new-clone-of-reused-helper. THREE independent axes, in this order: (1) acked findings are suppressed entirely (acked= counts them); (2) ORIGIN — a finding on a symbol that EXISTED at the baseline is preexisting-worse (no origin attribute), one that exists only because the code is NEW carries origin="new-symbol"; (3) MATERIALITY — a small numeric delta is sev="minor", and minor= counts them. EXIT 2 fires only on preexisting-worse AND major, the gating= count; new-symbol rows never gate, so exit 0 is NOT a verdict on them — nothing that existed got worse, but the new debt is yours: read them. Clone kinds are new-symbol only when EVERY member is new; short-horizon-churn is preexisting by construction. preexisting-worse= and new-symbol= partition regressions=. stale= is a FOURTH axis, never gating and never counted in regressions=: rows in the .ripwire_quality_acks ledger whose target no longer applies. api-new-surface= COUNTS the new PUBLIC symbols (never gates, not in regressions=, printed even at zero). register-macro-excluded= is a FLOOR, not a finding: symbols this run excluded from the dead-code kind because their own definition is a registered self-registering test/benchmark macro call. Never gates, never counted in regressions=, printed even at zero (zero means none excluded, not that the check did not run). A gating row's next= is the one pasteable follow-up: expand on FILE:NAME, the body to fix (a duplication row names a SET and carries none). bar= on a complexity/verbosity/nesting/params row is the threshold now= is judged against (ccx 15, loc 60, nest 4, params 5). baseline="git-HEAD" means no sidecar existed, so the working tree was auto-compared against the HEAD tree — anything already committed cannot appear. at= is the git commit (plus a dirty marker when the working tree differs) this list was computed at. The registered families are doctest/Catch2 TEST_CASE, GoogleTest TEST/TEST_F/TEST_P, Google Benchmark BENCHMARK, plus any name a .ripwire_config register_macros= line adds; each registers itself through a static initializer the call graph cannot see, so zero in-edges on one is not evidence of anything. IDENTITY across a rename or a move: a finding is keyed path::scope::name, which a rename would destroy, so the baseline and the .ripwire_quality_acks ledger are both re-filed into the CURRENT tree's identity before either is read, by two EXACT mechanisms — git's own rename record, and equality of a whitespace-and-name-scrubbed body hash — never a similarity heuristic. renames= is how many rename pairs were read, rename_window_commits= how deep the commit window went, acked_by_rename= and acked_by_content= how many of the acked= suppressions each mechanism is responsible for. Three appear ONLY when true, so an absent one is not a silent no: renames_window_truncated= (history is deeper than the window), renames_truncated= (the pair cap was hit), renames_ambiguous= (an ancestor two current symbols both claim — refused rather than guessed). ORIGIN reads the re-filed baseline too, so a regression carried in with a rename is judged preexisting-worse and GATES instead of slipping through as new-symbol. FLOORS, stated because silence here would read as a guarantee: the two clone kinds key on a member-SET hash and are NOT re-filed, so a clone ack still dies on a rename; ORIGIN follows the rename record but never content, because the baseline stores no content id at all; and a move git recorded no rename for still reads as new-symbol. Each sa row carries key= (the ack identity as stored) and why=, which is target-gone (the key names no symbol or group any more) or finding-gone (the target survived, this kind just does not fire on it). sym= and p=path:line name WHICH ack it is, and are present exactly when the key still names a live symbol: on every finding-gone row, on none of the target-gone rows (there is nothing left to name), and on neither clone kind — a clone key hashes a member SET that no single symbol carries, so those rows are unnameable by construction rather than guessed at. Hygiene disclosure only — the ledger file is never auto-edited. -->

*Fast per-symbol post-edit contract check vs git HEAD (unchanged on a clean tree).*

`````
<!-- ripwire edit-check: SYM's contract (param count + publicness) NOW vs git HEAD — unchanged/new-symbol/contract-change, or no-baseline when the root has no git HEAD to compare against (not a repository, or no commit yet): then NOTHING is claimed about the contract, and a symbol is never called new for want of a baseline — plus its 1-hop callers. A caller is flagged incompatible="1" when its argument count was reliably counted and NO definition in the folded set could accept it: every one has a FIXED arity that disagrees. A variadic, defaulted or implicit-receiver definition (a Python/Ruby method, whose params counts the self/cls the call site never writes) has no fixed arity and is never flagged. That makes the ARITY half one-sided — a call the compared definitions could accept is never flagged — but it is NOT a proof that the call site binds to THIS definition. Call edges are matched by NAME, so a receiver-qualified call to a same-named callee this tool does not index (a standard-library or third-party method) is measured against the one definition it does index; a clean, compiling tree can therefore carry a nonzero incompatible= with nothing edited at all, and on a widely-shared name it can be most of that name's callers. Read incompatible= as a fact about the tree as it stands — call sites worth OPENING, not a verdict — and status= as a fact about the edit. Warm path hits the qheadsnap/qsnap cache — never a full quality-delta style recompute. defs= is how many DEFINITIONS at this site (same file, same scope, same name — the overload set) are folded into this one contract; a selector matching more than one SITE is refused instead, so defs= only ever counts overloads. params_was and params_now are the MAX over that set on each side (the same MAX the baseline snapshot stores), and publicness is the OR. That MAX has TWO consequences, in opposite directions. It can read like a break and not be one: adding a WIDER overload beside an unchanged one raises params_now with no existing definition altered, so it reports status="contract-change" with incompatible="0" and a def row still carrying the old parameter count — no seen caller breaks. And it can read like safety and not be: REMOVING an overload whose parameter count is BELOW the MAX moves neither number, because the MAX survives on both sides, while the call site that used the removed definition no longer binds. defs_was=/defs_now= is what closes that: the count of definitions sharing this symbol's DEFINITION SITE — same file, same scope, same name — on each side. That is the population the baseline snapshot buckets by, so the two numbers answer the same question and are equal on an unedited tree. A same-named definition in ANOTHER FILE is a different contract and is counted on neither side, so defs_now= agrees with the root's defs= by construction and only defs_was= can move it. status is therefore the join of THREE was-vs-now facts — the params MAX, publicness, and the definition COUNT — and change= names which of them carried it. change= adds broken-callers when a seen caller is also flagged, but never on its own — for the reason stated at the top: incompatible= describes the TREE and status= describes the EDIT, so a headline must not turn on it. RESIDUAL: an overload whose arity changes BELOW the MAX while the COUNT stays the same moves none of the three. The root's incompatible= is the COUNT of flagged callers (a c row's incompatible="1" is the per-caller flag). sites_l= rides on a flagged row only: a c row's p= is where that CALLER is DEFINED, and sites_l= is the ascending LINE list of its call-role reference sites to this name — the lines to open, the same rows the uses verb prints, including the ones whose argument count could not be counted (so sites_l= can be wider than the evidence the flag rests on). Two calls on one line are ONE site. p= is the definition the selector resolved to; when defs is above 1 EVERY folded definition is listed as its own def row (p=, t=, params=), which is what tells a widened single definition apart from an added overload. At defs="1" no def row is emitted: the root's own p=/t= is that definition, and params_now is its parameter count. next= is the one pasteable follow-up: on a contract-change the uses verb on SYM (the call sites), otherwise the test gate on the definition's file. est_tokens= prices THIS document, through the tool's ONE emitted-bytes estimator. counts_floor="1" means every count here is a FLOOR, never a total: edges are extracted from source TEXT by NAME. Missing: dynamic dispatch (virtual/interface/duck-typed), a most-vexing-parse declaration with no call expression, a function-pointer/callback bound to more than one function in scope (reassigned, table-indexed, lambda-bound, or address-taken/reference-bound), and a plain-name binding (fp=handler) whose variable type is not PROVABLY a function pointer (a same-file typedef/declarator; a HEADER typedef is missed; auto/template types are read as unpinned, so KEPT). A macro-generated call site is role="macro" only when its name uniquely names an indexed function-like #define (C-family, t="macro"); a shared name stays a plain call, an unindexed macro is no edge. Read a zero as "none found", never as "none exists". graph_ambiguous=/graph_unresolved= are the whole graph's resolver gauge (calls split over several defs / calls whose in-repo defs were all language-filtered), the map header's ambiguous=/unresolved=. graph_unindexed=N is a third gauge: files no grammar could read (the map header's unindexed=), whose calls raise neither gauge above; absent when zero, and so is this sentence. COUNTING UNIT differs by verb: callers, callees, edit-check, graph-query and pr-context counts are DISTINCT SYMBOLS (repeated calls from one caller, and calls to two overloads, collapse into ONE row; multiplicity survives only in the call graph's edge weight). The reach counts (impact's reaches=, pr-context's dependents=) are the size of a transitive reach SET, each symbol counted once. The uses verb counts call SITES, one row per occurrence — a larger count there for the same symbol is these units agreeing, not disagreeing. The map header's edges= is a unit again different — distinct (caller,callee) PAIRS — and that document carries neither this marker nor this clause. -->

*Select the genuinely-unmerged refs of one family and feed them to merge-scout for a landing order (a merged family yields an empty landing set — still a measurement, disclosed on the root).*

**wall time: 5.10s**

`````
<!-- ripwire landing-plan: stray-content's cheap per-blob sweep composed with merge-scout's per-arm overlap oracle — of every local branch, which still hold REAL work (v="unmerged"), which were already re-implemented on the live line (v="superseded", EXCLUDED below — landing them re-does work that is already done) or are already merged (omitted entirely, counted in merged= on the root element), and the fewest-conflicts-first order to land what remains. scouted="0" on an unmerged ref means it was NOT fed to merge-scout this run (the cost bound, not a verdict) — it is still real, unscouted work; bounded= on the root element counts them and detail lifts the bound. merge-scout is the EXPENSIVE step here (git-archive + full ingest per arm) — stray-content's own sweep is the cheap one. An undetermined row is a ref that could NOT be analysed at all (no merge base with HEAD, which on a SHALLOW clone is every ref): it is neither scouted nor excluded nor merged, because nothing was measured — treat it as unfinished business and deepen the clone, never as a clean branch. Read-only throughout: no checkout, no ref write, no working-tree mutation. The root carries BOTH head= and at= and they are the same commit: head= is the bare 9 hex chars this verb has always printed, at= is the tool wide anchor and is head= plus a "+dirty" suffix when the working tree is not clean. Prefer at= (it is the one spelling every other repo reading verb uses, and the only one that tells you whether uncommitted work was in scope); head= is kept for callers already keyed to it. -->

**wall time: 1.59s**

`````
<!-- ripwire abi: the cross-branch ABI-BREAK gate — layout(STRUCT) crossed with stray-content(BRANCH). Scope is what each ref AUTHORED: the paths `diff base..tip` reports against its own merge base, never `diff HEAD..tip` (a file the branch never opened cannot be a break the branch introduced, and on a long-lived tree that one distinction took 487 drift rows to 4). For each such path the SAME field-offset model layout uses is run LEXICALLY on the ref's git blob (never indexed) and compared against HEAD's computed fields. LISTED kinds: drift = the byte contract differs (the bug this check exists for, the only kind that exits 2); unknown = the ref-side copy could not be modelled (see ref_caveat) and is NEVER reported as unchanged; absent = the ref does not define the struct at that path. COUNTED but not listed (pass detail=N to print them): rename = identical slots and field types under different field NAMES, so every byte stayed where it was (a same-type field REORDER is lexically identical to a rename and lands here too); spelling and stub mirror layout's own harmless cases; head-moved = the ref's copy equals its own merge-base copy, so the LIVE LINE is what changed. head_only= counts candidate sites on paths only the live line touched (outside the authored scope); unmodelable= counts sites skipped because HEAD's own copy carries no baseline; every excluded row is on a counter, nothing is dropped silently. Structs that match are omitted entirely; unrelated= counts refs with no merge-base against HEAD at all (unrelated history — never even compared, so nothing for them CAN be dropped silently either) and, because such a ref never gets the chance to acquire a row, it ALSO lands in quiet= below (the two counters are not disjoint: a ref with no rows at all is counted in quiet= whether that is because nothing broke or because nothing was ever compared), and a ref whose every row is an excluded kind is counted in excluded_refs= and prints under detail=N. LIMITS: HEAD's own side is the WORKING TREE's layout answer, not a re-fetched git blob at HEAD's commit; a nested field type that ALSO changed on the ref resolves via HEAD's copy, not the ref's; the ref-side locator is index-free and file-scope (one namespace deep) only, so a struct nested in a class or wrapped in an extern C block reads absent rather than compared; the authorship anchor is per PATH, so a branch changing struct S in one file while the live line changes S's mirror in another is a merge hazard only layout(S) on the merged result can see. Single-root; read-only (cat-file/diff/merge-base only). at= is the git commit these numbers were computed at; a trailing +shallow means the clone's history is truncated (a depth-limited clone: churn counts only the commits present), and a trailing +dirty means the working tree differed from that commit (head= is the same commit, bare sha, kept for compatibility). -->

## `./build/ripwire . --whereis=rankGraphTeleport`

*Which ref's tree defines or mentions SYM — HEAD first, then every local branch.*

**wall time: 2.02s**

`````
<!-- ripwire whereis: every LOCAL ref whose TREE contains this symbol, HEAD first, and within a ref SOURCE files before test files before docs, then definitions before references, then path and line. The doc demotion is ORDER ONLY: a doc line that quotes a signature still reads as a definition to the heuristic below and still says kind="def", it is simply printed after the code. kind= is answered by TWO different mechanisms, and head_labels= says which one answered for HEAD: with head_labels="index" a HEAD row is kind="def" iff the PARSED index puts a definition there (one row per index def site), while every NON-HEAD row — and every row when head_labels="lexical" (no index was supplied, the index knows no def of this name, or the working tree has drifted from HEAD) — is a LEXICAL shape heuristic over raw blob text that was never ingested: it reads a quoted signature in a doc as a definition and can miss an unusual declarator. refs_scanned= is the SCAN DENOMINATOR (how many refs besides HEAD were read), NOT a count of refs that matched — hits= and the rows are the matched set. on-head="0" alongside ref hits is the case this verb exists for: content that lives only on a branch. A TREE scan can only find content some ref still carries, so hits="0" on its own does not distinguish a name this repo never had from one it deleted; run with the with_history flag and the fate row says which, naming the commit that removed it. ANCHORING: none, by design. This verb runs no diff at all — it scans each ref's FULL tree, which is what lets it find content a branch merely INHERITED (exactly what a merge base anchored diff would exclude), so nothing here can fire merely because HEAD moved. at= is sha-only here (never +dirty): a tree scan reads committed blobs, so the working tree's cleanliness does not enter the answer. SELECTOR: this verb takes a BARE symbol name, not the file:name spelling that callers, uses, impact, around, lego and edit_check accept. A file:name spelling is searched as a LITERAL string, no tree contains it, and the result is a true but useless hits="0" shaped exactly like a name this repo never had. When that is what happened, a selector-note element says so and its retry= is the bare name to re-run with. That element has three reasons, and r= names which: qualified-selector (a file:name spelling was searched literally), line-seed (an @FILE:LINE selector was RESOLVED to the definition enclosing that line before the scan, so sym= is that definition's name and spec= is what you typed), and near-miss (the scan found nothing and the INDEX holds a name one or two edits away — the tree zero is still a measurement, the note only says which zero it is). Its absence beside hits="0" means the zero IS a measurement. SCOPE: refs/heads only, which is every local branch (worktree branches included). Remote tracking refs are NOT scanned: they mirror local ones in the usual checkout and would double every row. The consequence on a FRESH CLONE, where the branches live under refs/remotes/origin and only the checked out one has a local head, is that this verb sees essentially one tree; refs_scanned= is that fact as a number, so read it before reading hits=. TRUNCATION: the trailing more element (more hits=N) is the rows AFTER this page, so shown plus more equals the rows from this page's offset on. It is not a second cap, and not a second vocabulary to page by: it is the SAME fact shown= / capped= / next_offset= carry, restated from the other end (what this page did not print). Page with limit= and offset=; the more element is absent exactly when this page reached the end of the hit list. COMPLETENESS: complete= on the root (value 1) means this listing is EXHAUSTIVE and a consumer need not re-derive it: every occurrence of the symbol in every TEXT blob of every scanned ref's full tree is printed above — nothing was capped or paged out, and no blob was oversized (over the 2 MB blob ceiling), missing or cut short by the stream. The denominator is refs_scanned= plus HEAD, under SCOPE above (local heads only), so with complete= present a ref absent from the rows genuinely lacks the symbol in its committed tree. Binary blobs are outside the claim (a text symbol cannot occur in one); an oversized TEXT blob suppresses the claim instead of being silently skipped. Its ABSENCE claims nothing. raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it). -->

## `./build/ripwire . --whereis=computeOnePairOverlap --with-history`

*Same, plus a git-history <fate> row (never / removed-by-commit) for names no tree carries.*

**wall time: 5.10s**

`````
<!-- ripwire whereis: every LOCAL ref whose TREE contains this symbol, HEAD first, and within a ref SOURCE files before test files before docs, then definitions before references, then path and line. The doc demotion is ORDER ONLY: a doc line that quotes a signature still reads as a definition to the heuristic below and still says kind="def", it is simply printed after the code. kind= is answered by TWO different mechanisms, and head_labels= says which one answered for HEAD: with head_labels="index" a HEAD row is kind="def" iff the PARSED index puts a definition there (one row per index def site), while every NON-HEAD row — and every row when head_labels="lexical" (no index was supplied, the index knows no def of this name, or the working tree has drifted from HEAD) — is a LEXICAL shape heuristic over raw blob text that was never ingested: it reads a quoted signature in a doc as a definition and can miss an unusual declarator. refs_scanned= is the SCAN DENOMINATOR (how many refs besides HEAD were read), NOT a count of refs that matched — hits= and the rows are the matched set. on-head="0" alongside ref hits is the case this verb exists for: content that lives only on a branch. A TREE scan can only find content some ref still carries, so hits="0" on its own does not distinguish a name this repo never had from one it deleted; run with the with_history flag and the fate row says which, naming the commit that removed it. ANCHORING: none, by design. This verb runs no diff at all — it scans each ref's FULL tree, which is what lets it find content a branch merely INHERITED (exactly what a merge base anchored diff would exclude), so nothing here can fire merely because HEAD moved. at= is sha-only here (never +dirty): a tree scan reads committed blobs, so the working tree's cleanliness does not enter the answer. SELECTOR: this verb takes a BARE symbol name, not the file:name spelling that callers, uses, impact, around, lego and edit_check accept. A file:name spelling is searched as a LITERAL string, no tree contains it, and the result is a true but useless hits="0" shaped exactly like a name this repo never had. When that is what happened, a selector-note element says so and its retry= is the bare name to re-run with. That element has three reasons, and r= names which: qualified-selector (a file:name spelling was searched literally), line-seed (an @FILE:LINE selector was RESOLVED to the definition enclosing that line before the scan, so sym= is that definition's name and spec= is what you typed), and near-miss (the scan found nothing and the INDEX holds a name one or two edits away — the tree zero is still a measurement, the note only says which zero it is). Its absence beside hits="0" means the zero IS a measurement. SCOPE: refs/heads only, which is every local branch (worktree branches included). Remote tracking refs are NOT scanned: they mirror local ones in the usual checkout and would double every row. The consequence on a FRESH CLONE, where the branches live under refs/remotes/origin and only the checked out one has a local head, is that this verb sees essentially one tree; refs_scanned= is that fact as a number, so read it before reading hits=. TRUNCATION: the trailing more element (more hits=N) is the rows AFTER this page, so shown plus more equals the rows from this page's offset on. It is not a second cap, and not a second vocabulary to page by: it is the SAME fact shown= / capped= / next_offset= carry, restated from the other end (what this page did not print). Page with limit= and offset=; the more element is absent exactly when this page reached the end of the hit list. COMPLETENESS: complete= on the root (value 1) means this listing is EXHAUSTIVE and a consumer need not re-derive it: every occurrence of the symbol in every TEXT blob of every scanned ref's full tree is printed above — nothing was capped or paged out, and no blob was oversized (over the 2 MB blob ceiling), missing or cut short by the stream. The denominator is refs_scanned= plus HEAD, under SCOPE above (local heads only), so with complete= present a ref absent from the rows genuinely lacks the symbol in its committed tree. Binary blobs are outside the claim (a text symbol cannot occur in one); an oversized TEXT blob suppresses the claim instead of being silently skipped. Its ABSENCE claims nothing. raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it). history probed="1" means the git-log name-history walk ran: commits= is how many it read (runProbe's own no-merges log, so a name deleted only inside a merge commit is invisible and not counted either), removed-names= how many distinct names it saw deleted at least once, and truncated="1" (absent = not hit) means the walk stopped at its own commit ceiling before reaching the root. probed="0" r= says why it did not run at all (not-a-git-repo or probe-failed) — none of the other attributes are then present. -->

*The dark-content dashboard: gates BUILT but OFF. CHANGED: no longer invents gates from comments/heredocs, so the count only reflects real ifndef/define, CMake option(), and getenv gates.*

`````
<!-- ripwire flags: what is BUILT but DARK here. Three gate patterns in one report: ifndef/define header gates (kind="compile"), CMake option() switches (kind="cmake"), and getenv reads (kind="env", default unset). dark="1" means the default keeps the guarded code out of the build; regions/loc size what it turns off. When one name is BOTH a header gate and a CMake option the CMake default wins (that is what the build passes) and the header shows as an also row. Lexical, not preprocessed: this reports the in-repo default, never the value your build used. dark_gates on this root is the COUNT of dark gates; it was spelled dark until that collided with the child bool. files= is THIS verb's own harvest scan (source + CMakeLists files it read looking for gates) — a wider crawl than the map's indexed corpus, so it will not equal the map's files= -->
<!-- ROWS AND WHAT IS NEVER CUT: the gate rows ARE the answer this verb was asked for and are never windowed, capped or paged, and gates/dark_gates/compile/cmake/env/files on the root plus regions/loc/reads/dark on every gate are counted over the FULL set before any cap exists. What pages is the read SITES under one gate, at 8 a gate by default: a gate whose sites were cut says shown_reads= (the rows this run printed) with reads_capped="1", against the reads= total already on the same element, and the more reads= child keeps naming the remainder. The pair is emitted ONLY on a gate that was cut, never as a capped="0" on the gates that fit. limit=N raises the per gate cap (offset=M skips that many sites in every gate), detail lifts it entirely, and next= on the root is the exact pasteable invocation that shows every site this run dropped. -->

## `./build/ripwire . --flags --flip=RIPWIRE_ASAN`

*Blast radius of turning ONE gate on: live code, symbols, transitive reach, covering tests.*

`````
<!-- ripwire flip: the blast radius of turning ONE gate ON. lights = the code that becomes live: r rows are #if regions, b rows are C++ branch sites (a gate read as a VALUE through a constexpr bool, via= names the binding). hosts = the indexed defs that code sits inside; downstream = what those defs transitively CALL (what starts executing); dependents = what transitively calls THEM. tests = test files reaching the hosts; untested = hosts no test reaches (the honest is it safe answer). An alias MASTER rolls its children in (member rows); flipping a CHILD lights only that child and names its parent. kind=cmake also steers the BUILD graph, which no C++ side analysis follows: those sites are c rows. kind=env is RUNTIME (runtime=1) so every row is conditional at its read. Lexical and single line, never preprocessed: the value lane reads C family source only and treats a file declaring its OWN constant of that name as shadowing the gate's, but a third header's same named constant (included, not redeclared) would still count. A lit site inside no indexed def counts into filescope instead of a host. run= is the command that discharges a test row; run_unknown="1" means none is derivable for that harness (a guess would be worse than none) — a row carries one or the other, never neither. UNIT: untested= here counts HOSTS (indexed defs this gate lights that no test reaches). The test gate verb spells untested= over impacted SYMBOLS and the seams verb over cross-directory call EDGES, so the three numbers count three different things and must never be compared or summed across verbs. ROWS AND WHAT IS NEVER CUT: the t rows are the tests_to_run answer and are never windowed, capped or paged, exactly as the test gate verb serves its own — a listing you act on is not a listing that may be trimmed. Every other listing here is CONTEXT and pages at 25 rows by default: r and b inside lights, hosts, downstream, untested and the build sites. A listing that was cut says so on its own wrapper, against the n= (or r=/b=) total already there: shown_hosts= with hosts_capped="1", and the same pair under shown_downstream=, shown_untested=, shown_r=, shown_b= and shown_build=. The pair rides ONLY a listing that was actually cut, never as a capped="0" on one that fit, and the more rows= remainder beside it is unchanged. THE VERDICT IS NEVER THE WINDOW: family/regions/loc/branches/bindings/hosts/filescope/downstream/dependents/tests/untested/files on this root are counted over the FULL sets before any cap exists, so raising or removing a cap cannot move one of them. limit=N raises every context cap (offset=M pages them), detail lifts them all, and next= is the exact pasteable invocation that shows every row this run dropped. -->

<!-- ripwire doc drift: the CHECKABLE anchors in this repo's markdown, verified against the live index, reporting only the ones that no longer hold. Four kinds: file:line refs (missing-file / past-eof / line-moved, the last only when the doc names a symbol on that line), backticked symbol mentions (undefined), `= N` constants and `[N]` array extents (value/extent vs the declaration). Every lane under reports on purpose: a name is stale only when it occurs NOWHERE in the code as an identifier, and a number is compared only against a declaration shaped literal the corpus binds uniquely. checked + unchecked == anchors: nothing is dropped silently, and the unchecked rows say what was not proved. Read why="undefined" precisely: it says the name is defined NOWHERE in this repo, which is not the same as DELETED — in a plan or design doc naming work not yet built, that is expected rather than rot. Run with the with_history flag to have git history separate the two: the lane then reports why="deleted" with the commit that removed the name, and downgrades a name this repo never had to unchecked r="never in history". A failed anchor the AUTHOR DATED is split out as kind="dated-record" and counted in dated= rather than drift=: an audit finding, a ledger row or an as-of-DATE hedge records what was true then, so drift= is the LIVE rot and drift + dated is every anchor that no longer holds. rec= names the evidence (line / block / title / stamp), and a doc that never writes its own date anywhere a machine can read reports LIVE — the lane reads dating marks, it does not guess genre. Attribute vocabulary, one name one meaning: at= appears ONLY on this root element and is the commit the run was measured against (short sha, plus dirty when the tree had uncommitted changes); ref= is the anchor as the DOC writes it; got= is what the corpus actually says; and tgt= is the corpus SITE backing got= (a path, or path:line). On the <a/> rows k= and kind= are DIFFERENT things and both are kept: k= is the ANCHOR kind (file-line / symbol / const / array), kind= is the record classification (dated-record). k= cannot be renamed to kind= here for the obvious reason that kind= is already taken on the same element; note that in the ranked map the same k= spelling is a PageRank score instead. Docs are ordered by LIVE drift descending (path breaks ties), so the worst rot leads and a fully dated doc, which is drift zero by construction, sinks on the same key. Prose claims, Status lines and dates are NOT checked. A `path:A-B` RANGE gets one more structural check: why="range-straddles" fires when A's innermost symbol does not reach B (got= then names whatever occupies B instead, tgt= that site), regardless of whether the doc names a symbol. weak-file-line, the one unchecked reason that names no symbol, gets a FREE disclosure instead of a verdict: <weak-file-line p= n=> groups, one per doc, list every such anchor whose line DOES sit inside an indexed symbol, and each <w> row's resolves-to= names it — the verb still does not know if that is the symbol the doc meant. This section sits beside, not inside, the <doc> rows: a doc can appear in it while still counting toward clean=, and every row it lists still counts once in the unchecked r="weak-file-line" tally below. docs_unread=, when present, is the count of indexed documents this scan could NOT read (permissions, a race with a writer) — they are not in docs= and their anchors were not checked; absent means none. FOUR COUNTERS on this element name four DIFFERENT populations, stated here because one of them openly disagrees with a number the map reports elsewhere. docs= is the DOCUMENTS scanned for anchors (markdown by extension, after any filter); it is the denominator of the doc rows below. clean= is how many of those docs came out with NO failed anchor — drift and dated both zero for that doc — so docs minus clean is exactly the number of <doc> rows below, before any paging window is applied. A doc whose anchors were all unchecked, or all prose, is clean here: clean means nothing was found rotten, not that everything was verified. prose= is the anchors dropped as prose, so it is SUBTRACTED from anchors= rather than added to it, and the verb does not claim to have checked them; only the VALUE shapes (`= N` and `[N]`) can be dropped this way, and the drop is itself a corpus lookup — the name was searched for and not found in code — not a pre-check guess. corpus= is the file population the anchors were checked AGAINST, and it is its OWN population rather than a relation to the map's files=: the indexed files this walk could re-read, PLUS a fixed set of config, shader and build-file extensions (CMakeLists.txt, .cmake, .yml/.yaml, .toml, .metal/.glsl/.hlsl and the like — an extension whitelist, never a content sniff), MINUS every file this walk could not open or that exceeded its own 4 MiB read ceiling, which is dropped silently and never counted. So corpus= is USUALLY larger than files= and that is the normal case, but it is not always: a crawl run whose max file size ceiling was raised above 4 MiB indexes files this walk still refuses, and a file the index lists but this run cannot open is counted by one and not the other. Neither number is wrong. corpus="0" means the corpus scan never ran at all, which happens only when the docs raised no anchor SHAPE whatsoever — prose ones included — so anchors="0" beside a non-zero prose= still scanned, and still reports the corpus it scanned. PER-DOC ROW LISTINGS AND WHAT THEY DISCLOSE. The <a> rows under a <doc> are the FAILED anchors of that doc and they are capped, by default at 12 a doc. A doc whose listing was cut says so on its own element: shown_failed= is how many <a> rows this run printed, failed_capped="1" says rows were dropped, and failed_total= is the whole failed population for that doc — which is drift= + dated=, stated as its own number so no reader has to sum two attributes to learn what was cut, and deliberately NOT spelled anchors_total=, because anchors= on the same element counts EVERY anchor in the doc and not these rows. The <weak-file-line> groups cap the same way and disclose the same way against their own n=: shown_weak= with weak_capped="1". Both pairs are emitted ONLY when the cut happened — no element carries a capped="0" that could never fire — and the more drift= / more weak= remainders they sit beside are unchanged. THE VERDICT IS NEVER THE WINDOW: docs=, clean=, anchors=, checked=, unchecked=, drift=, dated= and prose= on this root, and drift=/dated=/anchors=/checked= on every <doc>, are computed over the FULL anchor set before any cap exists, so raising or removing the cap cannot move one of them. limit=N does NOT raise this cap and is not meant to: it windows the <doc> ROWS, which are this report's primary listing, and one flag governing both would make the same doc print a different number of anchor rows depending on the page it was served on. The flag that lifts the per-doc cap entirely is detail=N (any N above zero), and next= on this root is exactly that invocation, emitted only when a listing was cut. -->

*The finishable to-do list: docs whose LIVE failing anchors a date-stamp would reclassify.*

<!-- ripwire doc drift: the CHECKABLE anchors in this repo's markdown, verified against the live index, reporting only the ones that no longer hold. Four kinds: file:line refs (missing-file / past-eof / line-moved, the last only when the doc names a symbol on that line), backticked symbol mentions (undefined), `= N` constants and `[N]` array extents (value/extent vs the declaration). Every lane under reports on purpose: a name is stale only when it occurs NOWHERE in the code as an identifier, and a number is compared only against a declaration shaped literal the corpus binds uniquely. checked + unchecked == anchors: nothing is dropped silently, and the unchecked rows say what was not proved. Read why="undefined" precisely: it says the name is defined NOWHERE in this repo, which is not the same as DELETED — in a plan or design doc naming work not yet built, that is expected rather than rot. Run with the with_history flag to have git history separate the two: the lane then reports why="deleted" with the commit that removed the name, and downgrades a name this repo never had to unchecked r="never in history". A failed anchor the AUTHOR DATED is split out as kind="dated-record" and counted in dated= rather than drift=: an audit finding, a ledger row or an as-of-DATE hedge records what was true then, so drift= is the LIVE rot and drift + dated is every anchor that no longer holds. rec= names the evidence (line / block / title / stamp), and a doc that never writes its own date anywhere a machine can read reports LIVE — the lane reads dating marks, it does not guess genre. Attribute vocabulary, one name one meaning: at= appears ONLY on this root element and is the commit the run was measured against (short sha, plus dirty when the tree had uncommitted changes); ref= is the anchor as the DOC writes it; got= is what the corpus actually says; and tgt= is the corpus SITE backing got= (a path, or path:line). On the <a/> rows k= and kind= are DIFFERENT things and both are kept: k= is the ANCHOR kind (file-line / symbol / const / array), kind= is the record classification (dated-record). k= cannot be renamed to kind= here for the obvious reason that kind= is already taken on the same element; note that in the ranked map the same k= spelling is a PageRank score instead.

THE VERDICT IS NEVER THE WINDOW: docs=, clean=, anchors=, checked=, unchecked=, drift=, dated= and prose= on this root, and drift=/dated=/anchors=/checked= on every <doc>, are computed over the FULL anchor set before any cap exists, so raising or removing the cap cannot move one of them. limit=N does NOT raise this cap and is not meant to: it windows the <doc> ROWS, which are this report's primary listing, and one flag governing both would make the same doc print a different number of anchor rows depending on the page it was served on. The flag that lifts the per-doc cap entirely is detail=N (any N above zero), and next= on this root is exactly that invocation, emitted only when a listing was cut. history probed="1" means the git-log name-history walk ran: commits= is how many it read (runProbe's own no-merges log, so a name deleted only inside a merge commit is invisible and not counted either), removed-names= how many distinct names it saw deleted at least once, and truncated="1" (absent = not hit) means the walk stopped at its own commit ceiling before reaching the root. probed="0" r= says why it did not run at all (not-a-git-repo or probe-failed) — none of the other attributes are then present. -->

# self-diagnosis

*Environment self-check: binary staleness, grammars, cache dir, git, tracked-binary staleness — exit 1 when any check fails (here: the PATH install is older than ./build).*

**exit code: 1**

`````
<!-- doctor: checks=/passed= are the row count/how many passed; each <c name= ok=> is one check, its OTHER attributes are check-specific (see help). cache-dir's blobs= is capped at 4096 (kMaxCacheBlobCount); blobs_floor="1" means the cap fired and blobs= is AT LEAST that many, not exactly (absent = the true count); truncated="1" covers that AND an I/O error mid-scan, so blobs_floor= is the narrower, more useful claim when both matter; locks= counts the advisory edit-lock files under locks/ (never unlinked by their holder; the unheld ones older than a day are swept on the next cache write). binary-path compares CONTENT: same_bytes 1 is the copied-install case (ok, copied 1) whatever the mtimes say; on_path 0 fails the row and its hint carries the export line, the state a fresh install is in until PATH is fixed. git's shallow 1 means the clone's history is depth-limited, so every churn number counts only the commits present. volatile= on a row NAMES that row's own attributes that read LIVE machine state — cache-dir scans a per-user directory every ripwire process writes into, so two runs of this deterministic binary legitimately differ in exactly those fields and in nothing else; a determinism comparison strips the named attributes, never the row. tracked-binaries' truncated="1" means the git-history scan was SKIPPED entirely (too many tracked files), so its stale="0" there means unmeasured, never a clean scan. index-cache states the INDEX-VERSION CONTRACT (cache_version/parser_ver_lean/parser_ver_rich/artifact_arch — an artifact is reusable only by a binary carrying all four) and, for the artifact this root would consume, whether THIS binary can open it: lean=/rich= are one of ok | absent | not-regular | unreadable | truncated | not-a-cache | format-version | parser-version | artifact-arch | checksum | corrupt-frame, plus disabled (the no-cache flag: nothing was consulted, which is neither ok nor absent). That is a FORMAT verdict on an artifact, NEVER a freshness verdict on the index: every invocation re-validates each file, so an answer is not stale because lean= is not ok — it is merely slower. source= says whether the artifact was named on the cache= flag or picked automatically, and only a NAMED artifact this binary cannot read is ok="0" (a missing auto blob is the ordinary cold-start miss). git-config-trust reads the checkout's OWN core.fsmonitor as this process saw it at startup: hook is a COMMAND git would run on every read-only call, and neutralised="1" says core.fsmonitor=false was appended to git's environment override for this run (stderr said so as git_harden=fsmonitor-hook); builtin, off and unset are left untouched and neutralised="0". NB no flag below is spelled with its leading dashes: an XML comment may not contain a double hyphen, and this legend is one comment. -->

<!-- ripwire callers/callees: the 1-hop call hierarchy read off the call graph — the callers form lists symbols that CALL of=; the callees form lists symbols of= itself calls. of= is the selector you passed, defs= how many DEFINITIONS it resolved to (rows UNION every def's neighbours), count= the DISTINCT neighbour symbols (a floor, per counts_floor=), windowed by limit= and offset=. A neighbour that is an indexed function-like #define is a macro row (t="macro", role="macro" on the XML row): the edge crosses a macro expansion, not a plain call — rows carry no role= otherwise. Rows are ordered SOURCE first, then test/bench, then docs, by path within a tier. hop_tested=/hop_untested= partition count= by the tested= lens below (1-hop, never transitive). tested="1" on a row means an indexed test transitively reaches it (never 0, omitted when it does not). BLIND SPOT the test-gate legend also names: only a CALL EDGE from an INDEXED test symbol counts here, so a shell or CLI-level test running a built binary as a SUBPROCESS is invisible to it and a repo tested that way reads all-untested. Read untested= as no in-process test reaches it, not as no test covers it. next= is the one pasteable follow-up (the uses verb on this selector: the call sites). counts_floor="1" means every count here is a FLOOR, never a total: edges are extracted from source TEXT by NAME. Missing: dynamic dispatch (virtual/interface/duck-typed), a most-vexing-parse declaration with no call expression, a function-pointer/callback bound to more than one function in scope (reassigned, table-indexed, lambda-bound, or address-taken/reference-bound), and a plain-name binding (fp=handler) whose variable type is not PROVABLY a function pointer (a same-file typedef/declarator; a HEADER typedef is missed; auto/template types are read as unpinned, so KEPT). A macro-generated call site is role="macro" only when its name uniquely names an indexed function-like #define (C-family, t="macro"); a shared name stays a plain call, an unindexed macro is no edge. Read a zero as "none found", never as "none exists". graph_ambiguous=/graph_unresolved= are the whole graph's resolver gauge (calls split over several defs / calls whose in-repo defs were all language-filtered), the map header's ambiguous=/unresolved=. graph_unindexed=N is a third gauge: files no grammar could read (the map header's unindexed=), whose calls raise neither gauge above; absent when zero, and so is this sentence. COUNTING UNIT differs by verb: callers, callees, edit-check, graph-query and pr-context counts are DISTINCT SYMBOLS (repeated calls from one caller, and calls to two overloads, collapse into ONE row; multiplicity survives only in the call graph's edge weight). The reach counts (impact's reaches=, pr-context's dependents=) are the size of a transitive reach SET, each symbol counted once. The uses verb counts call SITES, one row per occurrence — a larger count there for the same symbol is these units agreeing, not disagreeing. The map header's edges= is a unit again different — distinct (caller,callee) PAIRS — and that document carries neither this marker nor this clause. -->
<!-- root= on this element is the crawl root every p= below is RELATIVE to (single-root runs only; absent => p= is the path ingest itself used, unchanged). -->
<!-- format=columnar: PARALLEL ARRAYS, not per-row attributes — the t=/n=/p= attributes this verb's XML row form carries are NOT emitted in this form. Zip by index: <paths> maps `I=path`; each array under <cols> holds exactly n= comma-separated values in ONE shared row order, and the path column is an index into <paths>. fields= names the columns, in array order. n="0" (an empty page) means every array is present and empty. A ',' inside a VALUE is escaped as &#44; (ordinary XML entity decoding restores it), so splitting a row array on ',' can never mis-zip. -->

  note: `ripwire` here is the DEFAULT MAP's structural-only PageRank (importance, not
        relatedness) — it is NOT what a --for/--query retrieval call ranks with. BM25 /
        BM25sub / BM25body are QUERY-TIME lexical rankers (whole-name / subtoken /
        subtoken+body); fused = RRF(ripwire, BM25sub); anchored = BM25body + anchored PPR
        expansion (--for --anchor, EXPERIMENTAL). The SHIPPED default for --for/--query is
        the subtoken+body lexical family (routed to name-exact only for an identifier-shaped
        query — lexical.h chooseForRanker), so a gap between the ripwire and BM25* rows here
        is structural-importance-vs-lexical-relatedness on a co-change task, not the shipped
        retrieval path losing to an alternative it was never running.

  note: routing chose name-exact on 3997/4000 NAME queries (a NAME query is always identifier-shaped);
        the confidence gate routes doc-phrase queries to name-exact ONLY when EVERY content word names a symbol
        (or an explicit camel/snake token appears) AND every matched name is specific enough to anchor on —
        a common name (many definitions, or a subtoken carried by many symbol names) declines the route — so
        conceptual prose falls back to subtoken+body; routed tracks the better ranker on BOTH modes
        (routed==name-exact on name, ~=subtoken+body on doc-phrase).

## `./build/ripwire wrap claude`

*Print the recipe to wire ripwire into Claude Code as an MCP server.*

`````
# ripwire -> Claude Code (CLI-first)
# RECOMMENDED — this agent can run shell commands, so call the CLI directly. It costs
# nothing until you invoke it, and it reads CLAUDE.md, so the paste block below IS the wiring:
ripwire . --for="<your task>" --token-budget=2000
#
# ...then add --legend=compact to every FOLLOW-UP call: the legend is a small share of a --for
# bundle but most of a --callers/--uses/--impact answer, and the payload is byte-identical either
# way. `ripwire --help` carries the measured range (one place, gate-held) -- this line does not
# repeat it, because two copies of a number is one copy that goes stale:
#   ripwire . --callers=SYM --legend=compact
#
# ALTERNATIVE — register the MCP server instead, for a warm index across calls:
claude mcp add ripwire -- ripwire --mcp
# verbs the agent can then call mid-task (31 total):
#   read:             analyze, find_symbol, find_referencing_symbols, grep, cochange, memory_recall, situational_awareness, mentions, for, lego, owners, fetch_body, batch, flags, doc_drift, slice
#   flagship reflex:  exemplar, quality_delta, quality_baseline, impact, uses, path_between, connect, explore, from_trace, edit_check, whereis, stray_content
#   edit:             replace_symbol_body, insert_before_symbol, insert_after_symbol
bash skills/install.sh   # deploy to ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/skills (drift-gated)
bash skills/install.sh --hook   # RECOMMENDED: advisory Read/Grep -> ripwire CLI nudge + session primer (opt-in, never blocks)
#
# context wiring — a binary on PATH is invisible to an agent until its rules file says when
# to reach for it. Paste the block below into CLAUDE.md:
# --- paste into CLAUDE.md ---
## ripwire — deterministic codebase maps (on PATH as `ripwire`)
Reach for it BEFORE blind grep + whole-file reads. First call ~1s cold; after that warm, ~0.1s.
- Orient on a task: `ripwire <dir> --for="<task in words>"` — ranked, quality-annotated
  signatures. Paste symbol/file names from the issue verbatim; named mentions get anchored.
- One task: `--pack-task="<task>"`; before parallel agents: `--plan-lanes=N --task="<goal>"`, then read `lanes[].execution`.
- Have a stack trace / build error: `ripwire <dir> --from-trace=FILE` (`-` = stdin) —
  paste the error, don't paraphrase it into a query.

*Hold a LOCATION, not a name: the enclosing-definition chain at FILE:LINE (a compiler error, a diff hunk, a stack frame), outermost -> innermost.*

`````
<!-- ripwire at: the ENCLOSING-DEFINITION CHAIN at one FILE:LINE seed. p= the resolved file, l= the 1-based seed line, sym= the innermost enclosing definition's name (what the same seed resolves to in a selector position), chain= the row count. Rows are INDEXED definitions only, outermost first, innermost last: n= the definition's name, t= its kind tag, l= its own start line, el= its end line (1-based, inclusive). A namespace or any construct the index does not carry is NOT a row, so an outer scope can be absent rather than misnamed; a seed line inside no indexed definition is refused, never served as an empty chain. The same seed composes into any SYM selector as @FILE:LINE (callers, callees, impact, around, expand, uses, edit-check, slice, safe-delete, path, connect) and resolves to the innermost row. -->

</at>
`````

## `./build/ripwire . --callers=@src/graph.h:3359`

*The same seed in a SELECTOR position: @FILE:LINE resolves to the innermost enclosing definition, then --callers runs on it.*

`````
<!-- ripwire callers/callees: the 1-hop call hierarchy read off the call graph — the callers form lists symbols that CALL of=; the callees form lists symbols of= itself calls. of= is the selector you passed, defs= how many DEFINITIONS it resolved to (rows UNION every def's neighbours), count= the DISTINCT neighbour symbols (a floor, per counts_floor=), windowed by limit= and offset=. A neighbour that is an indexed function-like #define is a macro row (t="macro", role="macro" on the XML row): the edge crosses a macro expansion, not a plain call — rows carry no role= otherwise. Rows are ordered SOURCE first, then test/bench, then docs, by path within a tier. hop_tested=/hop_untested= partition count= by the tested= lens below (1-hop, never transitive). tested="1" on a row means an indexed test transitively reaches it (never 0, omitted when it does not). BLIND SPOT the test-gate legend also names: only a CALL EDGE from an INDEXED test symbol counts here, so a shell or CLI-level test running a built binary as a SUBPROCESS is invisible to it and a repo tested that way reads all-untested. Read untested= as no in-process test reaches it, not as no test covers it. next= is the one pasteable follow-up (the uses verb on this selector: the call sites). counts_floor="1" means every count here is a FLOOR, never a total: edges are extracted from source TEXT by NAME. Missing: dynamic dispatch (virtual/interface/duck-typed), a most-vexing-parse declaration with no call expression, a function-pointer/callback bound to more than one function in scope (reassigned, table-indexed, lambda-bound, or address-taken/reference-bound), and a plain-name binding (fp=handler) whose variable type is not PROVABLY a function pointer (a same-file typedef/declarator; a HEADER typedef is missed; auto/template types are read as unpinned, so KEPT). A macro-generated call site is role="macro" only when its name uniquely names an indexed function-like #define (C-family, t="macro"); a shared name stays a plain call, an unindexed macro is no edge. Read a zero as "none found", never as "none exists". graph_ambiguous=/graph_unresolved= are the whole graph's resolver gauge (calls split over several defs / calls whose in-repo defs were all language-filtered), the map header's ambiguous=/unresolved=. graph_unindexed=N is a third gauge: files no grammar could read (the map header's unindexed=), whose calls raise neither gauge above; absent when zero, and so is this sentence. COUNTING UNIT differs by verb: callers, callees, edit-check, graph-query and pr-context counts are DISTINCT SYMBOLS (repeated calls from one caller, and calls to two overloads, collapse into ONE row; multiplicity survives only in the call graph's edge weight). The reach counts (impact's reaches=, pr-context's dependents=) are the size of a transitive reach SET, each symbol counted once. The uses verb counts call SITES, one row per occurrence — a larger count there for the same symbol is these units agreeing, not disagreeing. The map header's edges= is a unit again different — distinct (caller,callee) PAIRS — and that document carries neither this marker nor this clause. -->

*Bare --slice=SYM: the INVENTORY of sliceable locals (<v n= l= t=/>), so a caller can pick VAR.*

`````
<!-- ripwire slice: NAME-BASED intra-procedural def-use slice of one variable inside ONE resolved definition (ARISE, arXiv:2605.03117). ROWS: one <s> per LINE touching VAR, source order — k= def|use|both|scope (both = the line writes AND reads it, `x += y`; scope = a Python global/nonlocal statement: neither read nor write, it introduces the name and never anchors a flow), t= the strongest role on the line (param > decl > assign > call-arg > read > global/nonlocal), CDATA = the trimmed line. Bare slice=SYM lists the sliceable locals: <v n= l= t=/> per BINDING at its declaration line, vars= their count. COUNTS: counts="as-classified" — not the graph verbs' counts_floor= — defs=, uses=, vars= and steps= are exact counts of what this classifier ROWED, neither floors nor totals of the program's truth: LOW where a write hides behind a call (limit 2), HIGH where a rowed occurrence is not this variable's (a pp="1" row, or a same-spelled member/attribute a grammar exposes as a bare identifier — Python/Java `o.v`). LIMITS, stated not implied: (1) reach= on the root names the REACHING-DEFINITION rule behind rd=: cfg (C-family, Python) = flow-sensitive — the next unconditional def of a binding KILLS on every path; defs JOIN at if/elif/else, switch (cases fall through), a loop's back-edge, try handlers/finally, for/while-else, match, #ifdef; return/break/continue/throw/raise end a path. linear (JS/TS, Go, Java, Rust) = source order, nothing joins. rd= on a use row = the lines of the defs reaching it (- = none); flow and since edges are this same table. The UNIT is the STATEMENT: uses read the state entering it, its defs apply after (x += 1 reads then kills). NOT branched, per construct: ?:, short-circuit, a conditional expression/comprehension, a lambda/closure/nested def/class body fold into their statement (a def inside applies there, once); goto falls through, untracked; global/nonlocal is tracked like a local (outside writes invisible); a try handler sees the state before every statement of its innermost try body; no alias analysis — a pointer/reference alias is invisible. (2) A WRITE HIDDEN BEHIND A CALL IS NOT A DEF: receiver mutation (v.push_back(x), buf.append(s)) rows k="use" t="read", and a write through an ARGUMENT — a by-reference/pointer parameter, an out-parameter, a function-like macro (SETIT( m )) — rows k="use" t="call-arg", because proving either writes needs the callee's body or the macro's expansion, which this slicer lacks; a false def is worse than a missing one (the flow walk stops at the NEXT def), so it declines to guess — such a variable reports defs= as its introduction alone and a flow of steps="0": no provable edge, not "never written". (3) BLOCK SCOPES ARE SEPARATED: a name declared more than once inside the definition is that many variables; an occurrence binds to the innermost enclosing scope whose declaration precedes it (blocks, loop/if/switch heads, catch clauses, lambdas/closures, per family; JS/TS let/const per block, var per function; Go `v := v+1` and Rust `let v = v+1` read the previous binding in their own initializer; Python is function-scoped — one binding per name, comprehension/lambda scopes not separated). A shadowed seed carries bindings= on the root and b= on every row — the declaration line it binds to; b="0" = no declaration inside the definition binds it (an outer name, or a use before its declaration). (4) PREPROCESSOR (C-family): a conditional region starting inside the definition is decided only by its literal — the body of `#if 0` and the `#else` of `#if 1` are dead, their rows dropped and counted as preproc_rows= (absent when zero); every other conditional (`#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if defined(X)`, `#if EXPR`, `#elif`) is build-dependent: its rows are kept and flagged pp="1", and in a flow a pp def does not kill the reach of the unconditional def before it (both are emitted); macro names in directive text are never occurrences. (5) JS/TS destructuring binders (`const { x, y: yy, z = 3, ...rest } = o`, `[a, b] = arr`, destructured parameters, for-of patterns) are locals defined at the pattern line; a default's right side and a computed key are reads. (6) A reserved word is never an occurrence (a degraded-parse artifact); slicing one refuses like any unknown VAR. (7) Intra-procedural: rows never cross into callees/callers (callers/uses give that half). Served: C/C++/ObjC (+CUDA/Metal), Python, JS/TS, Go, Java, Rust — any other language refuses loudly, never an empty success. -->

LIMITS, stated not implied: (1) reach= on the root names the REACHING-DEFINITION rule behind rd=: cfg (C-family, Python) = flow-sensitive — the next unconditional def of a binding KILLS on every path; defs JOIN at if/elif/else, switch (cases fall through), a loop's back-edge, try handlers/finally, for/while-else, match, #ifdef; return/break/continue/throw/raise end a path. linear (JS/TS, Go, Java, Rust) = source order, nothing joins. rd= on a use row = the lines of the defs reaching it (- = none); flow and since edges are this same table. The UNIT is the STATEMENT: uses read the state entering it, its defs apply after (x += 1 reads then kills). NOT branched, per construct: ?:, short-circuit, a conditional expression/comprehension, a lambda/closure/nested def/class body fold into their statement (a def inside applies there, once); goto falls through, untracked; global/nonlocal is tracked like a local (outside writes invisible); a try handler sees the state before every statement of its innermost try body; no alias analysis — a pointer/reference alias is invisible. (2) A WRITE HIDDEN BEHIND A CALL IS NOT A DEF: receiver mutation (v.push_back(x), buf.append(s)) rows k="use" t="read", and a write through an ARGUMENT — a by-reference/pointer parameter, an out-parameter, a function-like macro (SETIT( m )) — rows k="use" t="call-arg", because proving either writes needs the callee's body or the macro's expansion, which this slicer lacks; a false def is worse than a missing one (the flow walk stops at the NEXT def), so it declines to guess — such a variable reports defs= as its introduction alone and a flow of steps="0": no provable edge, not "never written". (3) BLOCK SCOPES ARE SEPARATED: a name declared more than once inside the definition is that many variables; an occurrence binds to the innermost enclosing scope whose declaration precedes it (blocks, loop/if/switch heads, catch clauses, lambdas/closures, per family; JS/TS let/const per block, var per function; Go `v := v+1` and Rust `let v = v+1` read the previous binding in their own initializer; Python is function-scoped — one binding per name, comprehension/lambda scopes not separated). A shadowed seed carries bindings= on the root and b= on every row — the declaration line it binds to; b="0" = no declaration inside the definition binds it (an outer name, or a use before its declaration). (4) PREPROCESSOR (C-family): a conditional region starting inside the definition is decided only by its literal — the body of `#if 0` and the `#else` of `#if 1` are dead, their rows dropped and counted as preproc_rows= (absent when zero); every other conditional (`#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if defined(X)`, `#if EXPR`, `#elif`) is build-dependent: its rows are kept and flagged pp="1", and in a flow a pp def does not kill the reach of the unconditional def before it (both are emitted); macro names in directive text are never occurrences. (5) JS/TS destructuring binders (`const { x, y: yy, z = 3, ...rest } = o`, `[a, b] = arr`, destructured parameters, for-of patterns) are locals defined at the pattern line; a default's right side and a computed key are reads. (6) A reserved word is never an occurrence (a degraded-parse artifact); slicing one refuses like any unknown VAR. (7) Intra-procedural: rows never cross into callees/callers (callers/uses give that half).

SPAN TIERS: each hit is classified by the tree-sitter span it sits in (code/comment/string) and this answer serves the CODE tier, or — when no hit is code — comment and string TOGETHER; tier= names what was served when it is not code, so a pattern living only in prose is answered, never emptied. tier_partial= (value 1, present only then) qualifies that label: it was elected over the CLASSIFIED hits ALONE while tier_unclassified= hits were never classified, so read it as the tightest tier PROVEN present, never as proof that no hit is code. Nothing past the budget is suppressed, so the partiality narrows what the LABEL may be read to mean, never which rows you got; its absence beside a tier= means the label is a fact. suppressed_comment=/suppressed_string= are the classified hits held back: not in hits=, and the reason complete= cannot appear. Pass grep-in=any (dashes omitted) for every tier. Hit files are parsed on demand under a fixed budget: tier_parsed= how many were classified, tier_budget= which ceiling stopped it (files or bytes, present only then — and the root then also carries counts_floor="1": the tier counts are floors while hits= stays exact and every row is served), tier_unclassified= hits in files nothing classified — always EMITTED, never suppressed. A byte-identical match at OTHER sites in the SAME file folds into the first <hit>'s n= (default 1, unset) and an at-tagged sibling element (l=/in=, self-closing) per extra site — never on a paged or grep-context/-before/-after answer (dashes omitted, illegal in an XML comment), where every site keeps its own <hit>. After the hit rows, <enc> rows list each DISTINCT enclosing symbol NAME of THIS page (first-appearance order, bounded by the page) with callers= its 1-hop DISTINCT-caller count, unioned across same-named defs like the callers verb (a FLOOR — dynamic dispatch contributes no edge), defs= how many defs the name grouped (only when more than one), cx= complexity; amp=/tested= join only when a metrics co-run already computed that lens. On a zero-hit answer a <suggest> element may follow: SUGGESTIONS, never matches — near= the nearest indexed symbol name (did-you-mean), next= a ready-to-paste conceptual fallback; absent for regex/non-word-like patterns or when nothing plausible exists. COMPLETENESS: complete= on the root (value 1) means this listing is EXHAUSTIVE and a consumer need not re-derive it: a LITERAL scan read every indexed file end to end, hit no collection ceiling, and printed every hit it found — so on this answer a zero really is zero and a hit absent above is absent from every indexed file. The claim is complete-within-the-index ONLY: most files the ingest skipped were never scanned (the skipped verb lists exactly which, with reasons; the ONE exception is the unindexed_files_scanned= class right below, itself never covered by complete=), and files outside the indexed roots are outside the claim. The largest single subtraction is named on the root itself: corpus_pruned_dirs= below counts the subtrees the built-in crawl denylist removed WHOLE, so read this claim as exhaustive over what was indexed, never over what is on disk. It never appears on a regex answer (the prefilter is a performance switch that may not change the answer, so neither mode claims), a capped or paged listing, or a scan that could not read a file; its ABSENCE claims nothing. The enc rows' caller counts stay FLOORS regardless — complete= speaks for the hit rows alone. unindexed_files_scanned= counts files outside the index (unsupported-ext, but text-looking — the skipped verb's own unsupported-ext class) that THIS answer additionally scanned for the same pattern; their hits print inside a trailing unindexed element (present only when it found something), holding its own <f> rows in the same shape as above, and never carry in= — there is no symbol table to check for such a file, which is not the same claim as file scope. THE TWO POPULATIONS: every count above — files, hits, shown, capped, total, complete — is the IN-INDEX search ALONE. unindexed_hits= sizes the second one, always stated (a zero included); the trailing unindexed element carries that same number as its own count= beside shown=/capped= and obeys the SAME window limit/offset set here (dashes omitted), so a one-row page is one row on BOTH lists and a page past its end is empty, not repeated. unindexed_files_skipped= (present only when nonzero) counts candidates this scan saw but did not read: over the max-file-size ceiling, sniffed binary, or unreadable. unindexed_candidates_capped="1" (present only when true) means the CANDIDATE list itself (the skipped verb's own 500-row-per-class cap) was already a floor, so files past it were never considered here either — see the skipped verb for every row. corpus_excluded= counts files a caller's own exclude filter kept OUT of the index entirely; corpus_oversize= counts files the crawl SAW but dropped for exceeding the size ceiling; corpus_pruned_dirs= counts the DIRECTORIES the BUILT-IN crawl denylist pruned whole — vendor, third_party, build, dist, out, target, node_modules and the rest — a directory count and not a file count, because files beneath a pruned subtree are never stat'd and so were never counted. All three answer what an otherwise-empty answer alone cannot: not in this repo, or in a file that was never scanned — the skipped verb itemizes the rows behind the first two and reports the third as its own pruned_dirs=. next= is the one pasteable follow-up: the at verb on the top hit; the next page (compact legend) when cut; the conceptual lens on a zero-hit answer. raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it); on the root, limit="0" means no explicit limit was given and the verb's own default page size shaped the window — never a zero-row page -->

After the hit rows, <enc> rows list each DISTINCT enclosing symbol NAME of THIS page (first-appearance order, bounded by the page) with callers= its 1-hop DISTINCT-caller count, unioned across same-named defs like the callers verb (a FLOOR — dynamic dispatch contributes no edge), defs= how many defs the name grouped (only when more than one), cx= complexity; amp=/tested= join only when a metrics co-run already computed that lens.

COMPLETENESS: complete= on the root (value 1) means this listing is EXHAUSTIVE and a consumer need not re-derive it: a LITERAL scan read every indexed file end to end, hit no collection ceiling, and printed every hit it found — so on this answer a zero really is zero and a hit absent above is absent from every indexed file. The claim is complete-within-the-index ONLY: most files the ingest skipped were never scanned (the skipped verb lists exactly which, with reasons; the ONE exception is the unindexed_files_scanned= class right below, itself never covered by complete=), and files outside the indexed roots are outside the claim. The largest single subtraction is named on the root itself: corpus_pruned_dirs= below counts the subtrees the built-in crawl denylist removed WHOLE, so read this claim as exhaustive over what was indexed, never over what is on disk. It never appears on a regex answer (the prefilter is a performance switch that may not change the answer, so neither mode claims), a capped or paged listing, or a scan that could not read a file; its ABSENCE claims nothing. The enc rows' caller counts stay FLOORS regardless — complete= speaks for the hit rows alone. unindexed_files_scanned= counts files outside the index (unsupported-ext, but text-looking — the skipped verb's own unsupported-ext class) that THIS answer additionally scanned for the same pattern; their hits print inside a trailing unindexed element (present only when it found something), holding its own <f> rows in the same shape as above, and never carry in= — there is no symbol table to check for such a file, which is not the same claim as file scope. THE TWO POPULATIONS: every count above — files, hits, shown, capped, total, complete — is the IN-INDEX search ALONE. unindexed_hits= sizes the second one, always stated (a zero included); the trailing unindexed element carries that same number as its own count= beside shown=/capped= and obeys the SAME window limit/offset set here (dashes omitted), so a one-row page is one row on BOTH lists and a page past its end is empty, not repeated. unindexed_files_skipped= (present only when nonzero) counts candidates this scan saw but did not read: over the max-file-size ceiling, sniffed binary, or unreadable. unindexed_candidates_capped="1" (present only when true) means the CANDIDATE list itself (the skipped verb's own 500-row-per-class cap) was already a floor, so files past it were never considered here either — see the skipped verb for every row. corpus_excluded= counts files a caller's own exclude filter kept OUT of the index entirely; corpus_oversize= counts files the crawl SAW but dropped for exceeding the size ceiling; corpus_pruned_dirs= counts the DIRECTORIES the BUILT-IN crawl denylist pruned whole — vendor, third_party, build, dist, out, target, node_modules and the rest — a directory count and not a file count, because files beneath a pruned subtree are never stat'd and so were never counted. All three answer what an otherwise-empty answer alone cannot: not in this repo, or in a file that was never scanned — the skipped verb itemizes the rows behind the first two and reports the third as its own pruned_dirs=. next= is the one pasteable follow-up: the at verb on the top hit; the next page (compact legend) when cut; the conceptual lens on a zero-hit answer. raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it); on the root, limit="0" means no explicit limit was given and the verb's own default page size shaped the window — never a zero-row page -->

## `./build/ripwire . --safe-delete=rankGraphTeleport`

*"Can I delete this?" — callers + transitive impact + every use site + how much of the radius is tested, composed in ONE call; risk= names what was found, never a verdict.*

`````
<!-- ripwire safe-delete: composes signals the tool already computes into one "can I delete this?" READ — never a verdict. defs= is resolveAllByNameQualified's match count, exactly as the impact/uses/callers verbs already disclose it. callers= is the 1-hop caller count (the callers verb's own walk over defs' in-edges); impact_reaches= is the FULL transitive blast radius (the impact verb's own walk); uses= is every read/write/import/call/extends SITE of the name (the uses verb's own walk), reference-name-based, so an overloaded name unions every definition's sites. All three are counts_floor= FLOORS, never totals — see COUNTING UNIT below. tested_self= is 1 when an indexed test transitively CALLS this symbol (the tested= lens; a test symbol itself is never counted, matching the metrics/for/exemplar verbs' rule), and radius_tested= plus radius_untested= partition impact_reaches= by that same lens — radius_untested= equal to impact_reaches= means NOTHING downstream is covered by an indexed test, the strongest signal here. dead_code_candidate= is 1 ONLY when this selector resolves to exactly ONE definition and it is the dead-code verb's own high-confidence shape (a source free function, non-header, internal/static linkage, zero direct callers); a 0 never means "in use", only that this narrow detector's preconditions do not hold here — run the dead-code verb for the full-corpus scan. ambiguous_callers= counts callers whose OWN outgoing calls include at least one that resolved to more than one candidate definition (g.ambOut, the same counter a ranked row's amb= reads). That is a caveat that one of the callers below MAY be reaching a different same-named definition, never proof that this one is (such a caller row carries amb=K, K its ambiguous calls, the map row's amb=); read the source if which-target matters. risk= NAMES what was found, never a go/no-go verdict, and this run reports untested-radius: callers or uses exist, and NONE of the transitive blast radius is test-covered. counts_floor="1" means every count here is a FLOOR, never a total: edges are extracted from source TEXT by NAME. Missing: dynamic dispatch (virtual/interface/duck-typed), a most-vexing-parse declaration with no call expression, a function-pointer/callback bound to more than one function in scope (reassigned, table-indexed, lambda-bound, or address-taken/reference-bound), and a plain-name binding (fp=handler) whose variable type is not PROVABLY a function pointer (a same-file typedef/declarator; a HEADER typedef is missed; auto/template types are read as unpinned, so KEPT). A macro-generated call site is role="macro" only when its name uniquely names an indexed function-like #define (C-family, t="macro"); a shared name stays a plain call, an unindexed macro is no edge. Read a zero as "none found", never as "none exists". graph_ambiguous=/graph_unresolved= are the whole graph's resolver gauge (calls split over several defs / calls whose in-repo defs were all language-filtered), the map header's ambiguous=/unresolved=. graph_unindexed=N is a third gauge: files no grammar could read (the map header's unindexed=), whose calls raise neither gauge above; absent when zero, and so is this sentence. COUNTING UNIT differs by verb: callers, callees, edit-check, graph-query and pr-context counts are DISTINCT SYMBOLS (repeated calls from one caller, and calls to two overloads, collapse into ONE row; multiplicity survives only in the call graph's edge weight). The reach counts (impact's reaches=, pr-context's dependents=) are the size of a transitive reach SET, each symbol counted once. The uses verb counts call SITES, one row per occurrence — a larger count there for the same symbol is these units agreeing, not disagreeing. The map header's edges= is a unit again different — distinct (caller,callee) PAIRS — and that document carries neither this marker nor this clause. -->

HEADER: indexed= is files= on the map; the ACCOUNTING INVARIANT is indexed= + oversize= + excluded= = the candidate population the crawl ENUMERATED, at every ceiling and exclude setting. unsupported_ext= counts source/text-looking files outside that population (binary/asset extensions are deliberately not counted — an unindexed .png is a picture, not a language this build failed to read — and neither is a file an exclude or the repository's own ignore rules hid: requested absence, not an unread language; the grep verb's unindexed scan reads exactly this class, nothing hidden); its per-extension breakdown is the <e x= files=/> rows, which the map header rolls up as unindexed= — a TOP-6 list, and the map's unindexed_exts= beside it names how many DISTINCT such extensions exist, present exactly when that list was cut and absent when it is complete. excluded_dirs= counts SUBTREES an exclude pruned: the walk stopped at the directory, so how many files are under them is UNKNOWN, not zero, and they are in no count here. pruned_dirs= counts the subtrees this build ALWAYS prunes by policy — the committed noise/vendor/build denylist and any directory holding a CMakeCache.txt — with the same consequence: the walk stopped there, their contents are UNKNOWN rather than zero, and they are in no count here. The two are separate because the answer to "why is my tree missing" differs: one is a rule you passed, the other is a rule this build carries. degraded_parse= / minified_suspect= count the h rows. ignored= is ignored_files= on the map: files git's OWN ignore rules cover (.gitignore / .git/info/exclude / core.excludesFile), tested LAST — after the extension, the exclude and the built-in denylist — so it only ever counts a file that would OTHERWISE have been indexed, and the accounting invariant above reads indexed= + oversize= + excluded= + ignored=. ignored_dirs= counts SUBTREES those rules pruned, with the same consequence excluded_dirs= carries: the walk stopped at the directory, contents UNKNOWN rather than zero. Both classes are rowed (why="ignored" for the files, why="ignored-dir" for the subtrees, bytes="0" on a subtree because a directory has no size this verb can honestly report). ignore_mode= names WHICH rule set applied: git (consulted and applied), off (the no-ignore flag), unavailable (no git work tree at this root, or no git binary — the full walk), root-ignored (the root is ITSELF inside an ignored subtree, so honouring the rules would empty the map — the full walk). Only ignore_mode="git" can put a non-zero number beside the two counters; every other mode means nothing was consulted, which is not the same claim as nothing being ignored. unmeasured= counts indexed files this run never parsed (a doc-format file extracted by the doc pass, a binary sniff or nesting guard refusal, a read failure) — they are absent from the health counts, not clean. rows_capped="1" means a row list hit its 500-row ceiling, so the rows are a SAMPLE of the count beside them; every count stays exact. A zero means none found. -->
<!-- why=extent-suspect on an <h> row = the file holds extent_suspect_syms= definitions whose extent, scope or kind FAILED a containment check (the map and bundle rows carry the reasons as extent_suspect=: name, head, scope, error); joined to the parse-health reasons comma-separated, and rowed even when the parse itself is clean. extent_suspect_files= on the root counts such rows. Nothing is dropped. -->
<!-- why=macro-blanked on an <h> row = this file's symbols come from a SECOND parse. Its first parse held error bytes, so macro_blanked= semicolon-less ALL-CAPS function-like macro invocations, each alone on its line directly inside a class/struct/union body (a shape the C-family grammars misread as a field missing its semicolon, letting one body swallow what follows it), were replaced by spaces with every offset and line unchanged, and that re-parse was adopted because it held STRICTLY FEWER error bytes; names, spans and bodies still read the original bytes. err=, err_ratio= and degraded-parse on such a row describe the ADOPTED parse: a row without degraded-parse parsed clean once blanked. A blanked invocation stays a use of the macro name for the uses verb (role=type, as the unrepaired parse recorded it) but is no call edge, and identifiers inside its parentheses are not recorded. macro_blanked_files= on the root counts such rows. Nothing is dropped. -->

<!-- ripwire quality-panel: THE SINGLE COMMAND, the whole panel of software-quality checks in ONE report, ranked ONLY by the COUNT OF DISTINCT EVIDENCE FAMILIES that fire; NO composite score, by contract. Rationale + worked reading: docs/COMMANDS.md quality-panel; every threshold is reused from its source lens. SIX FAMILIES, partitioned by KIND of evidence: structural (shape: complexity, size, nesting, params, readability rank) lexical (identifier text: naming rules) confusion (syntax: the atom rules) historical (git change frequency, measured PER FILE: every symbol carries its file's churn= and hrank= verbatim, file evidence inherited by the row, not the row's own history) colocation (how much you must READ outside this file) state (this function's OWN BODY touching non-local MUTABLE state). preset=the preset that produced this enabled=the families it COUNTS enabled_n=how many cut=distinct enabled families that must agree for a row families=how many exist. Presets SELECT and CUT, never weight: strict=the five families measured stable enough to stand behind a gate, cut 2 (historical is deliberately absent: a moving 12-month window re-shuffles on unchanged code) default=all six, cut 2 lenient=all six, cut 1. eligible=functions/methods with a body, the denominator ranked=rows that met the cut below_cut=fired at least one enabled family but fewer than the cut no_family=no enabled family fired (ranked= + below_cut= + no_family= = eligible=, always). s=one symbol: p=path:line n=name fam=distinct ENABLED families that fired of=enabled families EVALUABLE for it fired=their names uncounted=fired but not enabled here unavail=not measurable here. e=evidence in one fired family: f=family counted=1 when this preset counts it why=the measurements that crossed (a rule that fired N times reads rule*N). Absolute bars: bar_ccx=cognitive complexity bar_loc=physical lines bar_nest=max nesting depth bar_params=param count; a row shows only the ones that crossed. Rankings fire for the worst decile of their OWN corpus (RELATIVE: 'worst in THIS corpus', never 'bad in absolute terms'): rrank=readability rank (0 least readable) rcut=decile width rmeasured=functions measured; hrank=file churn rank (0 most changed) churn=in-window commit count hcut=decile width hranked=files with any in-window commit window=the churn window; crank=local-reasoning rank (0 reads most from outside its file) ccut=decile width cranked=functions resolving any outside definition. state has no threshold (fires on a direct access site): writes= reads= distinct cells the own body writes/reads. HONESTY: unavailable=families not evaluated at all unavailable_why=one reason each; a family listed there was NOT measured, so its absence from fired= is not evidence of health. An empty ranking or language coverage counts as not measured (hranked=0 voids historical, cranked=0 colocation); published denominators: cfiles=files the atom rules read cscope=eligible symbols in them lscope=symbols the naming rules read sfiles=files the state lens reads sscope=symbols in them cells=non-local mutable cells found. of= is enabled_n= minus the unavailable (a row never counts a family it could not evaluate); cut_reachable=0 when the cut exceeds of=, a fact about the corpus, never a clean bill of health. unreadable_files=files readability could not read (rrank= a floor); findings_capped=1 when a rule spent its per-rule budget, floor_rules=naming them (those families are FLOORS and the root carries counts_floor=1); state_floor=1 when the state lens saturated its budget (a FLOOR too). join=deep+untested is an annotation, NOT a seventh family (changes nothing: not fam=, not of=, not the order): deep= structural evidence (a body that SUSTAINS depth at bar_nest) that no indexed test reaches. tested_scope=symbols an indexed test reaches, the join's honest denominator; at tested_scope=0 the annotation is emitted on NO row. deep_untested=rows carrying it across the WHOLE set (unchanged by limit=). shown=symbol rows printed capped=1 when rows were dropped; the one limit=N offset=M window also prints total= has_more= next_offset= -->

## `./build/ripwire . --context-ratio --limit=8`

*The local-reasoning lens: to understand this symbol, how much must you know that is NOT in front of you (ent_ratio= edge share, read_ratio= token-weighted).*

`````
<!-- ripwire context-ratio: the LOCAL-REASONING lens — for one symbol (and the same numbers rolled up per file), how much of what you must resolve to understand it lives OUTSIDE its own file. ATTRIBUTION, because the fraction itself is published: the share of a unit's coupling that stays inside its own boundary is Beck and Diehl's per-class congruence (FSE 2011) and Martin's instability Ce/(Ca+Ce) is its crude ancestor. This verb is a REFINEMENT of that measure, not a new one. Two things are refined. First, the ratio is also taken over what a reader must READ (read_ratio=, weighted by the estimated tokens of the definitions to open) and not only over edge counts (ent_ratio=) — both are printed side by side so the weighting can be seen doing work. Second, the reference set is EVERY use site (call, value read, write, import, base class, member type), not calls alone, so a type whose whole outside context is a base class and a field is measured rather than missed. s=one measured symbol: p=path:line n=symbol name t=symbol kind. f=the same columns rolled up per file, which is a UNION over every reference site in the file — including the file-scope ones like includes and imports that belong to no symbol — and therefore NOT the sum of that file's symbol rows. sites=reference sites scanned for this unit, in every role ents=distinct in-corpus definitions those sites resolve to ents_out=how many of them are defined outside this unit's own file ent_ratio=ents_out divided by ents, the edge-count form files=distinct files holding those definitions files_out=how many of them are not this unit's own file rtok=estimated tokens of every entity definition, the whole span at 3.80 bytes per token, which is what a reader must actually read rtok_out=the outside-the-file part of rtok read_ratio=rtok_out divided by rtok, the READER-WEIGHTED form and the one this verb exists for. Both ratios print 0.000 when there is nothing to resolve (ents=0), which is not the same claim as a self-contained unit — read ents= first. ext=distinct referenced names with NO in-corpus definition. Local variables and parameters produce read and write sites, so they DOMINATE ext= on real code: it is not a count of external dependencies and it is excluded from both ratios. amb_names=distinct referenced names that resolved to more than one definition (a per-NAME tally; the map row's amb= is a per-CALL count of a different resolver), each of which is counted as an entity — resolution is NAME-BASED and language-gated, the same heuristic level the uses verb works at, never the call graph's narrowed resolution, because four of the five reference roles carry no resolution at all. defs_per_name_cap=the most definitions ONE name may contribute (the first that many in symbol id order); a corpus-ubiquitous name would otherwise swamp every row it appears in. defs_capped="1" ⇒ some name HAD more than that and its extra definitions were not counted, so the root also carries counts_floor="1" (ents=/rtok= are floors); absent ⇒ every name's definitions were all counted. body_bytes_per_token=the rate rtok= is converted at. ents= and files= are FLOORS: a name-based static scan cannot see dynamic dispatch, reflection, or a macro invocation whose #define is not indexed, so a zero means none FOUND, never none exists. units=symbols measured file_units=files measured. Rows come out most-outside-reading-first (rtok_out descending, then ents_out, then rtok, then id) — an ORDERING, never a grade, and never a threshold. shown_syms=symbol rows printed syms_capped=1 when symbol rows were dropped shown_files=file rows printed files_capped=1 when file rows were dropped; the symbol listing is the one limit=N and offset=M window, which also prints total= has_more= next_offset= offset= limit= -->

<!-- ripwire nonlocal-state: per function, the NON-LOCAL MUTABLE STATE it can reach, reads and writes kept apart. A cell is one mutable datum declared outside any local scope: a file or namespace scope variable, a function-local static (local in name only), or a Python module global. A const, constexpr or consteval declaration is NOT a cell. An INSTANCE FIELD is not a cell either, by definition: per-object state is a different hazard, answered per member by the uses verb's Owner.field selector — so a member access (o.x, this->x) and a bare name the enclosing method's own class declares as a field are never charged to a same-named global here. Rows are ordered MOST WRITES FIRST, then most reads. p=path:line n=symbol name writes=distinct cells this function or its transitive callees WRITE reads=distinct cells this function or its transitive callees READ direct_writes=the writes= subset written in this function's OWN body direct_reads=the reads= subset read in this function's OWN body cells_total=distinct cells reached (a cell both read and written counts once) cells_shown=cell children printed cells_capped=1 when a row's children were truncated. Each cell child: n=cell name p=the cell's declaration path:line dir=r for read, w for write, rw for both, taken over this function's OWN BODY AND its callee closure together at=one use site in this function's own body (direct cells; there may be more) at_dir=what the OWN-BODY sites do, which can be NARROWER than dir=: at_dir=r with dir=rw means this body only reads the cell and a callee is what writes it via=the nearest callee whose own body touches the cell (transitive cells; exactly one of at= or via= is present). cells=cells found in the corpus functions=functions reaching at least one cell shown=rows printed capped=1 when rows were dropped; raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it), which also prints total= has_more= next_offset= offset= limit= unanalyzed_langs=indexed languages this lens does NOT analyse, so their files contribute NO cells and NO rows; the analysis covers C++, ObjC and Python, the languages whose read and write use sites the index carries.

It cannot see: an indirect call (a virtual, an unbound or reassigned function pointer or callback, or a macro invocation whose #define is not indexed), so the callee closure stops early; a write through a pointer or reference that ALIASES a cell without naming it; a cell named only inside a macro; reflection-like or duck-typed dispatch. It can also OVER-count in one way: a local that SHADOWS a cell's name is charged to the cell unless ingest recorded a type binding for that local, which it does for typed and constructed locals only.

## `./build/ripwire . --ensemble --limit=8`

*The family join: per function, which of four orthogonal evidence families fire, ranked by how many agree.*

`````
<!-- ripwire ensemble: the FAMILY JOIN over four orthogonal evidence families, ranked by the COUNT OF DISTINCT FAMILIES that fire and by nothing else. There is NO composite score here, by contract: averaging correlated metrics re-weights one signal and calls it three, and a single quotable number is wrong the moment it is quoted. fam= is ordinal and every row carries its own evidence. The four families are structural (the shape of the code), lexical (the identifier text: the naming rules), confusion (the syntactic construct: the atom rules) and historical (git change frequency, measured PER FILE: every symbol in a file carries that file's churn= and hrank= verbatim, so this family is file evidence inherited by the row, not the row's own history). families=how many families exist eligible=functions and methods with a body, the denominator ranked=eligible symbols where at least one family fired no_family=eligible symbols where none did (ranked= + no_family= = eligible= exactly, on every run). s=one joined symbol: p=path:line n=symbol name fam=how many DISTINCT families fired of=how many families could be EVALUATED at all fired=their names unavail=families that could not be measured here. e=the evidence inside one fired family: f=family name why=the measurements that crossed, space separated; a lexical or confusion rule that fired N times reads rule*N. f=the per-file rollup: p=path top=the file's most corroborated symbol top_l=its line top_fam=its family count union_fam=how many distinct families fire ANYWHERE in the file union=their names syms=symbols in the file with at least one family. top_fam= is the STRONGER claim (several families agreeing on ONE symbol); union_fam= is weaker (different families on different symbols) and the rollup is ranked by the stronger one. THRESHOLDS, all stated here. Four structural signals are ABSOLUTE bars, reused verbatim from the quality-delta bars: bar_ccx=cognitive complexity bar_loc=physical lines bar_nest=max nesting depth bar_params=parameter count; a row shows only the ones that crossed, with the value that crossed. Two signals are RANKINGS with no defensible absolute cut, so each fires for the worst decile of its own ranking, at least one row and at most 40 (each verb's own default window): rrank=the symbol's rank in the readability lens (0 is least readable) rcut=how many ranks that decile covers rmeasured=functions the readability lens measured; hrank=the file's rank by git churn (0 is most changed) churn=its in-window commit count hcut=how many ranks that decile covers hranked=files with any in-window commit window=the churn window. An ordinal cut is RELATIVE: some symbol is always in the worst decile of its own corpus, so rrank= and hrank= mean 'worst in THIS corpus', never 'bad in absolute terms'. The historical family ranks by churn ALONE, not by the hotspots score (churn x complexity), because half of that product is the structural family and two families that cannot disagree are one family counted twice. unavailable=families that could not be evaluated at all, with unavailable_why= saying why, one reason per unavailable family (§L10: both absent, never ="", when every family was measured — house convention, absent means none). UNAVAILABLE is never the same as silent: an ABSENT unavailable= means every family was measured, and a family listed there was NOT measured, so its absence from fired= is not evidence of health. An EMPTY ranking counts as not measured, so hranked=0 makes the historical family unavailable: a corpus scanned from outside the repository that tracks it mines zero churn for every file, and that silence is not a fact about the code. So does an empty LANGUAGE COVERAGE. The confusion family is the atom pack, which by design runs only on C/C++/ObjC/CUDA paths, so on a corpus with no eligible function in one it was never applicable rather than quiet: cfiles=indexed files it can read cscope=eligible symbols inside them, and cscope=0 makes it unavailable. The lexical family is the naming pack, which has no opinion about a data or doc language: lscope=eligible symbols in a language it reads, and lscope=0 makes it unavailable. The structural family has no such precondition - its bars and its readability rank are computed for every language. of= on each row is 4 minus the unavailable families, so a row NEVER counts a family that could not have been evaluated for it, and fam= cannot reach 4 on a corpus where one family was never applicable. unreadable_files=indexed files the readability lens could not read, so rrank= is a floor over what it saw. findings_capped=1 when a lexical or confusion rule spent its per-rule budget, with floor_rules= naming them: those families are then FLOORS and the root carries counts_floor=1. A naming or atom finding that lies outside every function body is not joined to any symbol and is not counted here. shown_syms=symbol rows printed syms_capped=1 when symbol rows were dropped shown_files=file rows printed files_capped=1 when file rows were dropped; the symbol listing is the one limit=N and offset=M window, which also prints total= has_more= next_offset= offset= limit= -->
<!-- at= is the git commit these numbers were computed at; a trailing +shallow means the clone's history is truncated (a depth-limited clone: churn counts only the commits present), and a trailing +dirty means the working tree differed from that commit, so the numbers describe the tree, not the commit -->

*The corpus's OWN case-convention vote per (language, kind) group; off-convention names get a mechanical propose= (a suggestion, never a blind rename).*

`````
<!-- ripwire naming-consistency: TIER A convention normalization (NOTES.md section 9.2): the corpus's OWN case-convention choice, voted per (language, kind) group among MULTI-TOKEN eligible names (a single-token name, or one split only on digit boundaries, carries no case signal and is silently excluded from both voting and flagging). A group DECIDES only when its leading style clears both a sample floor and an agreement floor; short of either it reports style=UNAVAILABLE with why= naming which bar it missed, never a guessed winner. Every off-convention name in a DECIDED group gets propose=: its OWN subtokens mechanically recombined into the dominant style: no dictionary, no synonym judgment, so this is safe to suggest for that reason alone. propose= is a SUGGESTION, never a safe-to-blind-apply rename: an actual rename needs the uses verb to prove the complete reference set first. A mixed name (naming-case's own finding: a snake separator AND a camel transition inside ONE identifier) never wins a vote and is always flagged when its group has a decided convention. Exit 0 always: a lens, not a gate. groups=(language,kind) pairs with at least one styled name candidates=styled names scanned decided=groups that cleared both floors flagged=off-convention names in decided groups g rows: lang= kind=fn|var style=the group's dominant convention, or UNAVAILABLE agree=leading-style votes total=all voting-style votes in this group why=insufficient-sample|no-clear-convention when style is UNAVAILABLE (absent otherwise) f rows: p=path:line n=name lang= kind=fn|var style=this name's own convention (mixed for the internally inconsistent case) propose=the mechanically recombined form in the group's dominant style.

<!-- ripwire naming-calibration: each naming lint rule scored against this repo's OWN rename history. A NOISY PROXY, and that is the headline, not a footnote: developers rename for reasons that have nothing to do with name quality (rebrands, moves, API changes, type changes, reverts), so a pair labelled old to new is only WEAK evidence that the old spelling was the worse one. Read pairs= first; a small sample means nothing whatever the proxy says. pairs=labelled rename pairs that survived the join, the SAMPLE SIZE for every number below candidates=raw substitutions mined from the patch stream, before the join commits=commits walked hunks=diff hunks with content on both sides wide_hunks=hunks dropped for exceeding the per-side pairing cap drop_old_alive=candidates dropped because the old spelling is still an indexed name (so it was not renamed away) drop_new_absent=candidates dropped because the new spelling is no eligible indexed symbol at HEAD drop_ambiguous=candidates dropped because a name appeared on both sides of several candidates (a split, rework or revert) drop_old_skipped=candidates dropped because the lens would skip the old spelling, so no rule could ever have fired on it truncated=1 when a walk bound was hit, which makes candidates= a FLOOR probed=0 when there is no history to mine; r= says why the root's own at= is the git commit these numbers were computed at (a trailing +shallow means the clone's history is truncated (a depth-limited clone: churn counts only the commits present), and a trailing +dirty means the working tree differed from that commit); a p row's at= below is unrelated — a path:line location, not a commit r rows: n=rule name old=pairs where the rule fired on the ABANDONED spelling new=pairs where it fired on the CHOSEN spelling fired=old+new proxy=old/fired, the crude precision proxy, absent when fired=0 (0.50 is exactly chance: a rule that fires equally on both spellings has no signal) scope=group-rule marks a rule that fires on a RELATIONSHIP between co-visible names, which one pair cannot carry evidence about; it is reported unscored rather than as a meaningless 0/0. p rows: one labelled pair. o=old spelling n=new spelling sup=distinct hunks that showed the substitution at=path:line of the symbol the pair joined to old_fires=rules that fired on the old spelling new_fires=rules that fired on the new spelling (both absent when empty) -->

Each rule is scanned under its OWN match budget, so no rule is ever starved by a noisier one. A rule that spends its whole budget carries count_capped="1" — its count= is then a FLOOR (that rule's raw captures reached the per-rule budget; only its own matches can cap it); findings_capped="1" on the root ⇒ at least one PRINTED rule row is a floor (never inherited from a rule lint-select/lint-ignore dropped), and the root then also carries counts_floor="1" and capped="1": findings= and total= are floors, rows exist that no page holds. Absent = nothing was capped and every count= is a total. raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it). On the root, shown=/capped= are the ROW-COUNT pair (rows printed vs whether the DEFAULT payload byte-cap trimmed them, absent an explicit limit=) — a different fact from the per-rule count_capped="1" above, which is a MATCH-BUDGET floor on one rule's own count=; findings= is the true total unless findings_capped="1" floors it. A rule row's applicable="0" ⇒ NONE of its registered languages (the lint-catalog listing) are present in this corpus at all — its count="0" is structural inertness, never a measurement; the root's inert_rules=N tallies how many printed rows that is true for. lint-select=/lint-ignore=PREFIX[,...] narrow the printed rows to a family (e.g. cache-); the root then carries selected="K of N" plus the raw select=/ignore= you passed. naming_locals="1" on the root ⇒ the opt-in naming-locals modifier was on (the naming-* rules also read local variables inside already-flagged functions); absent ⇒ off, and the naming-* counts cover declarations only. Each rule row's own shown_rows=/rows_capped= is how many of THAT rule's rows fall inside the printed <f> window (the root's shown=/capped= trims a SORTED PREFIX of the combined findings, so a rule whose rows all sort past the cut carries shown_rows="0" rows_capped="1" while its count= stays the true total — never confuse a capped-away rule with one that measured zero); this is a DIFFERENT fact from the row's own count_capped="1" above (that rule's own raw-capture stream hit its per-rule match budget) — the two can disagree on the same row. A lint-rules row's compiled="0" ⇒ that rule's tree-sitter QUERY failed to compile for every linked grammar (a malformed or misspelled pattern) — its count="0" never ran at all, a different claim from applicable="0" above (a well-formed query whose declared language just is not in this corpus) and from an ordinary count="0" (a well-formed query that ran and found nothing); absent ⇒ the query compiled. -->

`````
<!-- ripwire cochange groups: the surprising=1 violating pairs, collapsed around the file each group names. core= is the file to look at; each <f p=> under it is a partner it co-changes with and has no transitive static dependency on, so one group replaces its partners= pair rows. together=/recur=/conf_core= are that pair's own numbers: together= is the shared commit count, recur= how many of sub_windows= equal-commit-count slices of window= it recurs in, and conf_core= is conf(core => partner) — of the CORE's commits, the fraction that also touched this partner. groups= is a GREEDY cover, not a proven minimal one (minimum set cover is NP-hard): it is an upper bound on the smallest number of groups, and repeatedly picking the file covering the most still-uncovered pairs is what produced it. pairs_covered= is the total membership count and equals the number of surprising=1 pairs, because every violating pair lands in exactly one group. min_recur= appears when cochange-recur=K (the flag) filtered the pairs BEFORE they were grouped.

*Only pairs whose co-change RECURS in 2+ sub-windows of the mined window (sub_windows= is the denominator) — a one-off sprint stops reading like a structural defect.*

`````
<!-- ripwire cochange: file pairs that change together in git but share no transitive static dependency (surprising=1) = hidden coupling. together= is the number of commits in window= that touched BOTH files (3 or more, or the pair is not reported); deg= is that count over the commit count of the LESS-CHANGED of the two files, so 1.00 means the quieter file never changed without the other. conf_ab= is that same fraction over a='s OWN commit count and conf_ba= over b='s, which is the asymmetric form: conf_ab=1.00 means a never changed without b. deg= is by construction the larger of the two, and driver= names which side it came from ("a" or "b") — the file whose changes most reliably imply the other's, and therefore the one to look at first. driver= is OMITTED when the two directions are equal, because a tie is not a finding. recur= is how many of sub_windows= the pair actually co-changed in: the mined window is cut into that many equal-COMMIT-COUNT slices (not equal time — a calendar slice can hold 400 commits or 4), so recur=1 at any together= is one burst of activity and not a persistent coupling, which is the distinction a single window cannot make. sub_windows= is the denominator and is never omitted; it is smaller than the nominal 3 only when the window holds fewer commits than that. min_recur= appears when cochange-recur=K (the flag) filtered the rows, so a short list is explained rather than silent. window= is the mining window: the default 18 months, or the since=REV|DATE value when one resolved. surprising= is only defined where BOTH sides could carry a static dependency at all, and that is a PAIR question, not a per-file one: both sides must be dependency-capable (the set deps <health dep_langs=> names) AND resolve in the SAME dialect, because a shell script cannot source a C++ translation unit and an #include cannot name a shell script. md, json, toml, yaml and binary/unknown files are capable of nothing; sh, rb, lua and ex became capable at parser version 81 and each answers only its own kind. A pair that fails either half keeps its row and carries dep_capable=0 instead, because for it "shares no static dependency" is vacuously true rather than evidence. raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it) -->

*The house PLAN/DESIGN format's STRUCTURE check — never semantics; exit 2 when a card or ledger row gates.*

**exit code: 2**

`````
<!-- ripwire plan-lint: STRUCTURE only, never semantics (the doc-drift lane already owns citation truth). A card is exactly an H3 heading opening with a task id ("T" + digits + up to three letters). A ledger is exactly one heading whose text, stripped of a leading section mark, reads "Status" case-insensitively.

That is a FORMAT verdict on an artifact, NEVER a freshness verdict on the index: every invocation re-validates each file, so an answer is not stale because lean= is not ok — it is merely slower. source= says whether the artifact was named on the cache= flag or picked automatically, and only a NAMED artifact this binary cannot read is ok="0" (a missing auto blob is the ordinary cold-start miss). git-config-trust reads the checkout's OWN core.fsmonitor as this process saw it at startup: hook is a COMMAND git would run on every read-only call, and neutralised="1" says core.fsmonitor=false was appended to git's environment override for this run (stderr said so as git_harden=fsmonitor-hook); builtin, off and unset are left untouched and neutralised="0".

<!-- ripwire quality-delta: only what a change made WORSE against the floor baseline= names below. Descriptive: weigh and fix the real ones, do not game the number (a wrong abstraction beats a low score). TEN KINDS, and kind= on every row names which one: complexity over the ccx bar, verbosity (LOC), nesting, params, duplication, dead-code, api-surface (new public contract drift), error-masking, short-horizon-churn, new-clone-of-reused-helper. THREE independent axes, in this order: (1) acked findings are suppressed entirely (acked= counts them); (2) ORIGIN — a finding on a symbol that EXISTED at the baseline is preexisting-worse (no origin attribute), one that exists only because the code is NEW carries origin="new-symbol"; (3) MATERIALITY — a small numeric delta is sev="minor", and minor= counts them. EXIT 2 fires only on preexisting-worse AND major, the gating= count; new-symbol rows never gate, so exit 0 is NOT a verdict on them — nothing that existed got worse, but the new debt is yours: read them. Clone kinds are new-symbol only when EVERY member is new; short-horizon-churn is preexisting by construction. preexisting-worse= and new-symbol= partition regressions=. stale= is a FOURTH axis, never gating and never counted in regressions=: rows in the .ripwire_quality_acks ledger whose target no longer applies. api-new-surface= COUNTS the new PUBLIC symbols (never gates, not in regressions=, printed even at zero). register-macro-excluded= is a FLOOR, not a finding: symbols this run excluded from the dead-code kind because their own definition is a registered self-registering test/benchmark macro call. Never gates, never counted in regressions=, printed even at zero (zero means none excluded, not that the check did not run). A gating row's next= is the one pasteable follow-up: expand on FILE:NAME, the body to fix (a duplication row names a SET and carries none). bar= on a complexity/verbosity/nesting/params row is the threshold now= is judged against (ccx 15, loc 60, nest 4, params 5). baseline="git-HEAD" means no sidecar existed, so the working tree was auto-compared against the HEAD tree — anything already committed cannot appear. at= is the git commit (plus a dirty marker when the working tree differs) this list was computed at. The registered families are doctest/Catch2 TEST_CASE, GoogleTest TEST/TEST_F/TEST_P, Google Benchmark BENCHMARK, plus any name a .ripwire_config register_macros= line adds; each registers itself through a static initializer the call graph cannot see, so zero in-edges on one is not evidence of anything. IDENTITY across a rename or a move: a finding is keyed path::scope::name, which a rename would destroy, so the baseline and the .ripwire_quality_acks ledger are both re-filed into the CURRENT tree's identity before either is read, by two EXACT mechanisms — git's own rename record, and equality of a whitespace-and-name-scrubbed body hash — never a similarity heuristic. renames= is how many rename pairs were read, rename_window_commits= how deep the commit window went, acked_by_rename= and acked_by_content= how many of the acked= suppressions each mechanism is responsible for. Three appear ONLY when true, so an absent one is not a silent no: renames_window_truncated= (history is deeper than the window), renames_truncated= (the pair cap was hit), renames_ambiguous= (an ancestor two current symbols both claim — refused rather than guessed). ORIGIN reads the re-filed baseline too, so a regression carried in with a rename is judged preexisting-worse and GATES instead of slipping through as new-symbol. FLOORS, stated because silence here would read as a guarantee: the two clone kinds key on a member-SET hash and are NOT re-filed, so a clone ack still dies on a rename; ORIGIN follows the rename record but never content, because the baseline stores no content id at all; and a move git recorded no rename for still reads as new-symbol. Each sa row carries key= (the ack identity as stored) and why=, which is target-gone (the key names no symbol or group any more) or finding-gone (the target survived, this kind just does not fire on it). sym= and p=path:line name WHICH ack it is, and are present exactly when the key still names a live symbol: on every finding-gone row, on none of the target-gone rows (there is nothing left to name), and on neither clone kind — a clone key hashes a member SET that no single symbol carries, so those rows are unnameable by construction rather than guessed at. Hygiene disclosure only — the ledger file is never auto-edited. ROWS: sym= is the canonical id the finding regressed on; was= and now= carry the before/after value for the numeric kinds; p="path:line" is the locator (root-relative; the first-sorting member for the clone kinds; omitted, never faked, when none resolves). churn= and surface= are per-kind classification facets (short-horizon-churn's self/ambient split; api-surface's new-symbol/contract-change tier). churn= facets never gate alone: the kind gates only on 2+ COMMITTED in-window rewrites of the edited lines. Every row the header's gating= counter counts also carries a gating attribute set to 1 — marked positively, never by the ABSENCE of sev or origin. CLONE ROWS name the whole group rather than one symbol: members= is the member list and tokens= its shared normalized-token count (the same per-group pair the clones verb reports). idiom= names a RECOGNIZED BODY SHAPE every member spells, out of a closed set of three (threshold-ladder, switch-name-table, builder-chain). idiom= alone changes nothing; a group that ALSO shares no non-keyword identifier between any two members, sits in pairwise-distinct enclosing contexts, and stays under 80 normalized tokens is an idiom COLLISION rather than a copy, and is reported minor instead of gating. Break any one of those and it gates as before, idiom= and all: two bucketing ladders over the SAME enum are a copy. The shape is read off the body's token stream and not a parse tree, so a macro-assembled body classifies as whatever its raw tokens spell — the name is printed so the call can be overruled by reading. -->

<!-- ripwire quality-delta: only what a change made WORSE against the floor baseline= names below. Descriptive: weigh and fix the real ones, do not game the number (a wrong abstraction beats a low score). TEN KINDS, and kind= on every row names which one: complexity over the ccx bar, verbosity (LOC), nesting, params, duplication, dead-code, api-surface (new public contract drift), error-masking, short-horizon-churn, new-clone-of-reused-helper. THREE independent axes, in this order: (1) acked findings are suppressed entirely (acked= counts them); (2) ORIGIN — a finding on a symbol that EXISTED at the baseline is preexisting-worse (no origin attribute), one that exists only because the code is NEW carries origin="new-symbol"; (3) MATERIALITY — a small numeric delta is sev="minor", and minor= counts them. EXIT 2 fires only on preexisting-worse AND major, the gating= count; new-symbol rows never gate, so exit 0 is NOT a verdict on them — nothing that existed got worse, but the new debt is yours: read them. Clone kinds are new-symbol only when EVERY member is new; short-horizon-churn is preexisting by construction. preexisting-worse= and new-symbol= partition regressions=. stale= is a FOURTH axis, never gating and never counted in regressions=: rows in the .ripwire_quality_acks ledger whose target no longer applies. api-new-surface= COUNTS the new PUBLIC symbols (never gates, not in regressions=, printed even at zero). register-macro-excluded= is a FLOOR, not a finding: symbols this run excluded from the dead-code kind because their own definition is a registered self-registering test/benchmark macro call. Never gates, never counted in regressions=, printed even at zero (zero means none excluded, not that the check did not run). A gating row's next= is the one pasteable follow-up: expand on FILE:NAME, the body to fix (a duplication row names a SET and carries none). bar= on a complexity/verbosity/nesting/params row is the threshold now= is judged against (ccx 15, loc 60, nest 4, params 5). baseline="git-HEAD" means no sidecar existed, so the working tree was auto-compared against the HEAD tree — anything already committed cannot appear. at= is the git commit (plus a dirty marker when the working tree differs) this list was computed at. The registered families are doctest/Catch2 TEST_CASE, GoogleTest TEST/TEST_F/TEST_P, Google Benchmark BENCHMARK, plus any name a .ripwire_config register_macros= line adds; each registers itself through a static initializer the call graph cannot see, so zero in-edges on one is not evidence of anything. IDENTITY across a rename or a move: a finding is keyed path::scope::name, which a rename would destroy, so the baseline and the .ripwire_quality_acks ledger are both re-filed into the CURRENT tree's identity before either is read, by two EXACT mechanisms — git's own rename record, and equality of a whitespace-and-name-scrubbed body hash — never a similarity heuristic. renames= is how many rename pairs were read, rename_window_commits= how deep the commit window went, acked_by_rename= and acked_by_content= how many of the acked= suppressions each mechanism is responsible for. Three appear ONLY when true, so an absent one is not a silent no: renames_window_truncated= (history is deeper than the window), renames_truncated= (the pair cap was hit), renames_ambiguous= (an ancestor two current symbols both claim — refused rather than guessed). ORIGIN reads the re-filed baseline too, so a regression carried in with a rename is judged preexisting-worse and GATES instead of slipping through as new-symbol. FLOORS, stated because silence here would read as a guarantee: the two clone kinds key on a member-SET hash and are NOT re-filed, so a clone ack still dies on a rename; ORIGIN follows the rename record but never content, because the baseline stores no content id at all; and a move git recorded no rename for still reads as new-symbol. The two mechanisms in full, because a suppression is a claim about identity: git's rename record is read with rename detection and the similarity threshold PINNED in the command, never inherited from the repo config, over a fixed COMMIT window rather than a wall-clock one, so the answer is the same everywhere; the content match is equality of a body hash scrubbed of whitespace and of the symbol's own name, for a move git recorded no rename for. A body that CHANGED is a different finding and is matched by neither. Each sa row carries key= (the ack identity as stored) and why=, which is target-gone (the key names no symbol or group any more) or finding-gone (the target survived, this kind just does not fire on it). sym= and p=path:line name WHICH ack it is, and are present exactly when the key still names a live symbol: on every finding-gone row, on none of the target-gone rows (there is nothing left to name), and on neither clone kind — a clone key hashes a member SET that no single symbol carries, so those rows are unnameable by construction rather than guessed at. Hygiene disclosure only — the ledger file is never auto-edited. ROWS: sym= is the canonical id the finding regressed on; was= and now= carry the before/after value for the numeric kinds; p="path:line" is the locator (root-relative; the first-sorting member for the clone kinds; omitted, never faked, when none resolves). churn= and surface= are per-kind classification facets (short-horizon-churn's self/ambient split; api-surface's new-symbol/contract-change tier). churn= facets never gate alone: the kind gates only on 2+ COMMITTED in-window rewrites of the edited lines. Every row the header's gating= counter counts also carries a gating attribute set to 1 — marked positively, never by the ABSENCE of sev or origin. CLONE ROWS name the whole group rather than one symbol: members= is the member list and tokens= its shared normalized-token count (the same per-group pair the clones verb reports). idiom= names a RECOGNIZED BODY SHAPE every member spells, out of a closed set of three (threshold-ladder, switch-name-table, builder-chain). idiom= alone changes nothing; a group that ALSO shares no non-keyword identifier between any two members, sits in pairwise-distinct enclosing contexts, and stays under 80 normalized tokens is an idiom COLLISION rather than a copy, and is reported minor instead of gating. Break any one of those and it gates as before, idiom= and all: two bucketing ladders over the SAME enum are a copy. The shape is read off the body's token stream and not a parse tree, so a macro-assembled body classifies as whatever its raw tokens spell — the name is printed so the call can be overruled by reading. -->

*A real contract-change: was=1 now=2 params, with the call sites that are now provably incompatible, and a pasteable next= (--uses=SYM) on the root.*

`````
<!-- ripwire edit-check: SYM's contract (param count + publicness) NOW vs git HEAD — unchanged/new-symbol/contract-change, or no-baseline when the root has no git HEAD to compare against (not a repository, or no commit yet): then NOTHING is claimed about the contract, and a symbol is never called new for want of a baseline — plus its 1-hop callers. A caller is flagged incompatible="1" when its argument count was reliably counted and NO definition in the folded set could accept it: every one has a FIXED arity that disagrees. A variadic, defaulted or implicit-receiver definition (a Python/Ruby method, whose params counts the self/cls the call site never writes) has no fixed arity and is never flagged. That makes the ARITY half one-sided — a call the compared definitions could accept is never flagged — but it is NOT a proof that the call site binds to THIS definition. Call edges are matched by NAME, so a receiver-qualified call to a same-named callee this tool does not index (a standard-library or third-party method) is measured against the one definition it does index; a clean, compiling tree can therefore carry a nonzero incompatible= with nothing edited at all, and on a widely-shared name it can be most of that name's callers. Read incompatible= as a fact about the tree as it stands — call sites worth OPENING, not a verdict — and status= as a fact about the edit. Warm path hits the qheadsnap/qsnap cache — never a full quality-delta style recompute. defs= is how many DEFINITIONS at this site (same file, same scope, same name — the overload set) are folded into this one contract; a selector matching more than one SITE is refused instead, so defs= only ever counts overloads. params_was and params_now are the MAX over that set on each side (the same MAX the baseline snapshot stores), and publicness is the OR. That MAX has TWO consequences, in opposite directions. It can read like a break and not be one: adding a WIDER overload beside an unchanged one raises params_now with no existing definition altered, so it reports status="contract-change" with incompatible="0" and a def row still carrying the old parameter count — no seen caller breaks. And it can read like safety and not be: REMOVING an overload whose parameter count is BELOW the MAX moves neither number, because the MAX survives on both sides, while the call site that used the removed definition no longer binds. defs_was=/defs_now= is what closes that: the count of definitions sharing this symbol's DEFINITION SITE — same file, same scope, same name — on each side. That is the population the baseline snapshot buckets by, so the two numbers answer the same question and are equal on an unedited tree. A same-named definition in ANOTHER FILE is a different contract and is counted on neither side, so defs_now= agrees with the root's defs= by construction and only defs_was= can move it. status is therefore the join of THREE was-vs-now facts — the params MAX, publicness, and the definition COUNT — and change= names which of them carried it. change= adds broken-callers when a seen caller is also flagged, but never on its own — for the reason stated at the top: incompatible= describes the TREE and status= describes the EDIT, so a headline must not turn on it. RESIDUAL: an overload whose arity changes BELOW the MAX while the COUNT stays the same moves none of the three. The root's incompatible= is the COUNT of flagged callers (a c row's incompatible="1" is the per-caller flag). sites_l= rides on a flagged row only: a c row's p= is where that CALLER is DEFINED, and sites_l= is the ascending LINE list of its call-role reference sites to this name — the lines to open, the same rows the uses verb prints, including the ones whose argument count could not be counted (so sites_l= can be wider than the evidence the flag rests on). Two calls on one line are ONE site. p= is the definition the selector resolved to; when defs is above 1 EVERY folded definition is listed as its own def row (p=, t=, params=), which is what tells a widened single definition apart from an added overload. At defs="1" no def row is emitted: the root's own p=/t= is that definition, and params_now is its parameter count. next= is the one pasteable follow-up: on a contract-change the uses verb on SYM (the call sites), otherwise the test gate on the definition's file. est_tokens= prices THIS document, through the tool's ONE emitted-bytes estimator. counts_floor="1" means every count here is a FLOOR, never a total: edges are extracted from source TEXT by NAME. Missing: dynamic dispatch (virtual/interface/duck-typed), a most-vexing-parse declaration with no call expression, a function-pointer/callback bound to more than one function in scope (reassigned, table-indexed, lambda-bound, or address-taken/reference-bound), and a plain-name binding (fp=handler) whose variable type is not PROVABLY a function pointer (a same-file typedef/declarator; a HEADER typedef is missed; auto/template types are read as unpinned, so KEPT). A macro-generated call site is role="macro" only when its name uniquely names an indexed function-like #define (C-family, t="macro"); a shared name stays a plain call, an unindexed macro is no edge. Read a zero as "none found", never as "none exists". graph_ambiguous=/graph_unresolved= are the whole graph's resolver gauge (calls split over several defs / calls whose in-repo defs were all language-filtered), the map header's ambiguous=/unresolved=. graph_unindexed=N is a third gauge: files no grammar could read (the map header's unindexed=), whose calls raise neither gauge above; absent when zero, and so is this sentence. COUNTING UNIT differs by verb: callers, callees, edit-check, graph-query and pr-context counts are DISTINCT SYMBOLS (repeated calls from one caller, and calls to two overloads, collapse into ONE row; multiplicity survives only in the call graph's edge weight). The reach counts (impact's reaches=, pr-context's dependents=) are the size of a transitive reach SET, each symbol counted once. The uses verb counts call SITES, one row per occurrence — a larger count there for the same symbol is these units agreeing, not disagreeing. The map header's edges= is a unit again different — distinct (caller,callee) PAIRS — and that document carries neither this marker nor this clause. -->

*The review-evidence bundle with an actual changed file.*

`````
<!-- ripwire pr-context: no-LLM review-evidence bundle per changed file — defined symbols, their callers, blast radius (transitive dependents), affected tests, co-change partners not in the diff, and owners. base=working-tree. skipped_mode_only=diffs that changed a file's MODE and nothing else (e.g. chmod) excluded from the changed set; a pure RENAME is content-identical too but is NOT excluded — it is a changed file, listed at its new path. files= means two different things by DEPTH here and is deliberately not renamed (15 consumers read the root one): on the ROOT it is the CHANGED file count; on each <impact/> child it is the distinct files dependents= reaches (changed + non-changed), so dependents="0" implies files="0" and vice versa — never an impossible-looking dependents>0/files=0. files_other= on the same <impact/> is the non-changed subset (a changed file's dependents inside OTHER changed files have no <f> row of their own — they are already shown as their own <file> section); it is NOT the <f> row count — see the row-cap sentence below. Files are ordered by BLAST RADIUS (transitive dependents descending, path breaking ties), not alphabetically. sections= on changed-symbols counts a doc file's headings, collapsed into that number instead of one callers-zero row each; count= still counts every INDEXED symbol, sections included, so count minus sections is the number of rows that follow. Every nested list below is a TOP-N subset of its element's own total, fixed per element (impact <f> at 20, per-symbol <caller> at 12, cochange <partner> at 12, tests <test> at 40, owners <author> at 5 — the L0 defaults; &lt;cochange window= commits=&gt;: the git window the partners were mined in (a DEFAULT window is measured back from HEAD's own committer date and says so: 18mo@HEAD) and how many commits it contained — commits=0 means the window could not look, which is not the same fact as no partners. max-tokens only lowers these further via the trim ladder, nothing raises them past L0): each capped element carries its own shown=/capped= pair so the cut is never silent — for the untrimmed list use impact=SYM/callers=SYM (blast radius/callers), affected=FILE or situ (tests), cochange (partners), or owners (authors) instead. direction= names which SIDE this bundle reviews (worktree-since-head, head-since-fork, head-since-ref-tip); a no-ref-work row says the base ref's tip IS the merge base, i.e. it carries no divergent work of its own. deterministic. BUDGET: the bundle is budgeted by default — budget_tokens= is the ceiling in force (8000 unless token-budget/max-tokens set it; budget_default=1 says the default applied); est_tokens= prices the WHOLE document this bundle emits, this legend included, at the map's markup rate of 2.50 bytes per token, and IS the number the ladder fits, so recounting the delivered bytes reproduces it; trim_level=/truncated= what the ladder dropped. When even the structural floor of every changed file exceeds it, the FILES are windowed in blast-radius order: shown= of files=, capped=1 with total=/has_more=/next_offset=/offset=/limit= (limit=0 = the default window), and next= is the one pasteable follow-up (the next page). truncated= carrying budget-floor-exceeded means the smallest document this bundle can render is STILL over budget_tokens= — including on a clean tree, whose whole document is this legend and has no ladder to descend; est_tokens= is then the honest ceiling, never a silent overshoot. counts_floor="1" means every count here is a FLOOR, never a total: edges are extracted from source TEXT by NAME. Missing: dynamic dispatch (virtual/interface/duck-typed), a most-vexing-parse declaration with no call expression, a function-pointer/callback bound to more than one function in scope (reassigned, table-indexed, lambda-bound, or address-taken/reference-bound), and a plain-name binding (fp=handler) whose variable type is not PROVABLY a function pointer (a same-file typedef/declarator; a HEADER typedef is missed; auto/template types are read as unpinned, so KEPT).

## `./build/ripwire . --clones`

*The duplicated helper the sandbox edit introduced shows up as a clone group.*

`````
<!-- ripwire clones: function bodies with similar normalized token streams (identifiers/literals normalized, so renamed copies match). type=2 exact/renamed (Type-1/2); type=3 gapped near-miss (an inserted/changed statement, similarity in [0.80,1.0)). Reuse don't reimplement; a fix to one likely belongs in all. groups= and type3= are the two GROUP-TYPE totals (each capped independently, so neither is the row count); total= is the true row total (groups + type3-group-count) and is ALWAYS present, paged or not; shown= is the number of group rows that follow this run. capped="1" means rows were dropped. exempt= on a group ⇒ every member is on a path the quality-delta verb's duplication kind deliberately ignores (fixture dirs / shell test-runners repeat boilerplate by convention) — a fact here, never a gate there; exempt_groups= counts them over ALL groups. idiom= on a group names the RECOGNIZED SHAPE every one of its members classifies to, from a CLOSED set of three: threshold-ladder (a chain of if-compare-return and nothing else), switch-name-table (a switch whose every arm is a label plus a literal return), builder-chain (a param-struct initializer chain). demoted="1" additionally means the quality-delta verb's duplication kind reports this group as minor rather than gating on it, which happens only when the WHOLE conjunction holds: every member the same recognized idiom, no two members sharing a single non-keyword identifier, no two members sharing an enclosing context (file plus scope), and the group under 80 normalized tokens. Five cross-domain bucketing ladders that share only the idiom are noise; two ladders over the same enum, or two in one namespace, are a copy. The idiom name is printed precisely so a human can overrule the demotion by reading the members: a demoted row is annotated, never removed. idiom_groups= and demoted_groups= count each of those over ALL groups. FLOOR on the classifier, since a silence here would read as coverage: the shape is read off the body's TOKEN stream and not a parse tree, so a macro-assembled body classifies as whatever its raw tokens spell; the table arm models case-labelled switches only; and builder-chain models the field-assignment spelling, not the fluent chained-call one. gid= on a row is its CLONE COMPONENT: the Type-3 pass reports PAIRS, so three functions that are all near-copies of each other arrive as three rows of two; rows sharing a gid are one cluster, and clone_groups= counts the clusters (union-find over the pair graph, over ALL detected rows, not just the shown ones). dup_pct=duplicated-LOC/total-LOC as a percentage, where duplicated-LOC sums, per cluster, every member's loc EXCEPT the largest member's (one instance is the code you keep, the rest is the redundancy — so a 3-clone cluster counts its lines TWICE) and total-LOC is every function/method body the detector considered; dup_loc= and total_loc= are those two operands. counts_floor="1": the Type-3 pair list is capped upstream, so a dropped pair is a cluster left unmerged — clone_groups/dup_loc/dup_pct are floors, never totals. raise the default cap with limit=N (offset=M pages; a cut listing carries total=/has_more=/next_offset= so a paging loop can continue from it). -->

## `./build/ripwire . --stray-content=zz-orphan`

*CHANGED: a ref with NO merge base with HEAD now reports v="unknown" ok="0" in its own bucket — the absence of an answer, never a claim it is merged. (The sandbox carries a deliberately parentless branch built with `git commit-tree`; a shallow CI clone puts every ref here.)*

`````
<!-- ripwire stray-content: per ref, the lines its own divergent work AUTHORED (vs its merge-base with HEAD) that the live line does NOT have. v="superseded" means the live line removed the same base code this ref removed (redone/del) — it re-implemented the work, the case `git cherry` cannot see; v="unmerged" means the work is genuinely absent; merged refs are omitted. Read-only: git cat-file/diff/ls-tree only, one batched cat-file for the whole sweep, every blob reduced once per sha. Line-granular, not semantic: see the ripwire help text for the limits. ANCHORING is a deliberate hybrid: the SCOPE is base anchored (only lines the ref itself authored vs its merge base are ever considered, so a file the ref never opened cannot appear because the live line moved), while the ABSENCE test is HEAD anchored on purpose (does the live line have this content TODAY is the question being asked, and it is only answerable against live HEAD). v="unknown" with ok="0" means this ref could NOT be analysed at all because it has no merge base with HEAD, which on a SHALLOW clone (the checkout default in CI) is every ref: it is not a claim that the ref is merged, and the fix is to deepen the clone. The four buckets are exhaustive, so unmerged plus superseded plus merged plus unknown always equals refs. SCOPE: refs/heads only, which is every local branch (worktree branches included). Remote tracking refs are NOT scanned: they mirror local ones in the usual checkout and would double every row. The consequence on a FRESH CLONE, where the branches live under refs/remotes/origin and only the checked out one has a local head, is that there is nothing here to be stray FROM; refs= is that fact as a number. TRUNCATION: a ref row ends with a more element (more files=N) when its own file listing was capped; shown plus that number equals the ref's files= total, always. That inner listing is a SECONDARY listing (it repeats complete and identical on every page) and is capped by detail, not by limit / offset, which page the OUTER ref listing and report their own shown= / capped=. at= is the git commit these numbers were computed at; a trailing +shallow means the clone's history is truncated (a depth-limited clone: churn counts only the commits present), and a trailing +dirty means the working tree differed from that commit (head= is the same commit, bare sha, kept for compatibility). -->

## `./build/ripwire . --stray-content=zz-orphan --plan`

*CHANGED: --plan surfaces those same refs as an <undetermined> row rather than silently dropping them.*

`````
<!-- ripwire landing-plan: stray-content's cheap per-blob sweep composed with merge-scout's per-arm overlap oracle — of every local branch, which still hold REAL work (v="unmerged"), which were already re-implemented on the live line (v="superseded", EXCLUDED below — landing them re-does work that is already done) or are already merged (omitted entirely, counted in merged= on the root element), and the fewest-conflicts-first order to land what remains. scouted="0" on an unmerged ref means it was NOT fed to merge-scout this run (the cost bound, not a verdict) — it is still real, unscouted work; bounded= on the root element counts them and detail lifts the bound. merge-scout is the EXPENSIVE step here (git-archive + full ingest per arm) — stray-content's own sweep is the cheap one. An undetermined row is a ref that could NOT be analysed at all (no merge base with HEAD, which on a SHALLOW clone is every ref): it is neither scouted nor excluded nor merged, because nothing was measured — treat it as unfinished business and deepen the clone, never as a clean branch. Read-only throughout: no checkout, no ref write, no working-tree mutation. The root carries BOTH head= and at= and they are the same commit: head= is the bare 9 hex chars this verb has always printed, at= is the tool wide anchor and is head= plus a "+dirty" suffix when the working tree is not clean. Prefer at= (it is the one spelling every other repo reading verb uses, and the only one that tells you whether uncommitted work was in scope); head= is kept for callers already keyed to it. -->

## `./build/ripwire . --dmm`

*The DMM scalar on a REAL delta: the sandbox edit grew one unit past the nesting/complexity thresholds and added an 8-parameter one, so dmm is low and the three sub-scores say which property moved.*

<!-- ripwire dmm: the Delta Maintainability Model (di Biase, Rastogi, Bruntink, van Deursen, TechDebt 2019), ONE comparable scalar per change. Thresholds and arithmetic are PyDriller's deltamaintainability reference implementation. A UNIT is a function or method definition WITH A BODY; its VOLUME is its line span. Per property a unit is LOW risk iff size: loc at most 15, complexity: cyclomatic at most 5, interfacing: params at most 2. good=volume of low-risk code ADDED plus high-risk code REMOVED bad=volume of low-risk code REMOVED plus high-risk code ADDED dmm=good/(good+bad), in [0,1]: 1.000 means every line this change moved made the code healthier. THIS IS A DELTA, NOT A LEVEL: editing bad code without growing it moves nothing and scores nothing, which is deliberate. dmm=UNAVAILABLE means good+bad was 0, i.e. the change moved no unit's size, complexity or parameter count, and is NEVER to be read as 1.000 or 0.000; reason= says which case it was. base=the earlier tree's commit target=the later tree's commit, or working-tree base_units= target_units= units measured on each side base_volume= target_volume= their total line span combine=how the root dmm= pools the three sub-scores (pooled = summed good over summed good+bad; the paper publishes the three separately and no aggregate, so this one is ripwire's) size_metric=physical-loc: volume is the definition's PHYSICAL line span, where the reference implementation uses non-comment non-blank lines, so a heavily commented unit crosses the size threshold here earlier at= is the git commit this comparison RAN at (HEAD, not base/target — those name what was compared); a trailing +shallow means the clone's history is truncated (a depth-limited clone: churn counts only the commits present), and a trailing +dirty means the working tree differed from that commit available=0 when no score could be produced at all low_loc=/low_cx=/low_params= are the low-risk ceilings a unit is judged against (lines / cyclomatic complexity / parameters). p=one property row k=its name (size|complexity|interfacing) d_low=change in low-risk volume d_high=change in high-risk volume.

## `./build/ripwire . --quality-delta --scope=src/graph.h`

*OWNERSHIP partition for a shared tree: every regression here lives in src/infra/, so under a scope naming src/graph.h they ALL print under <out-of-scope> with a do-not-ack banner and never gate — scoped-out-gating= says how many would have.*

**wall time: 2.19s**

`````
<!-- ripwire quality-delta: only what a change made WORSE against the floor baseline= names below. Descriptive: weigh and fix the real ones, do not game the number (a wrong abstraction beats a low score). TEN KINDS, and kind= on every row names which one: complexity over the ccx bar, verbosity (LOC), nesting, params, duplication, dead-code, api-surface (new public contract drift), error-masking, short-horizon-churn, new-clone-of-reused-helper. THREE independent axes, in this order: (1) acked findings are suppressed entirely (acked= counts them); (2) ORIGIN — a finding on a symbol that EXISTED at the baseline is preexisting-worse (no origin attribute), one that exists only because the code is NEW carries origin="new-symbol"; (3) MATERIALITY — a small numeric delta is sev="minor", and minor= counts them. EXIT 2 fires only on preexisting-worse AND major, the gating= count; new-symbol rows never gate, so exit 0 is NOT a verdict on them — nothing that existed got worse, but the new debt is yours: read them. Clone kinds are new-symbol only when EVERY member is new; short-horizon-churn is preexisting by construction. preexisting-worse= and new-symbol= partition regressions=. stale= is a FOURTH axis, never gating and never counted in regressions=: rows in the .ripwire_quality_acks ledger whose target no longer applies. api-new-surface= COUNTS the new PUBLIC symbols (never gates, not in regressions=, printed even at zero). register-macro-excluded= is a FLOOR, not a finding: symbols this run excluded from the dead-code kind because their own definition is a registered self-registering test/benchmark macro call. Never gates, never counted in regressions=, printed even at zero (zero means none excluded, not that the check did not run). A gating row's next= is the one pasteable follow-up: expand on FILE:NAME, the body to fix (a duplication row names a SET and carries none). bar= on a complexity/verbosity/nesting/params row is the threshold now= is judged against (ccx 15, loc 60, nest 4, params 5). baseline="git-HEAD" means no sidecar existed, so the working tree was auto-compared against the HEAD tree — anything already committed cannot appear. at= is the git commit (plus a dirty marker when the working tree differs) this list was computed at. The registered families are doctest/Catch2 TEST_CASE, GoogleTest TEST/TEST_F/TEST_P, Google Benchmark BENCHMARK, plus any name a .ripwire_config register_macros= line adds; each registers itself through a static initializer the call graph cannot see, so zero in-edges on one is not evidence of anything. IDENTITY across a rename or a move: a finding is keyed path::scope::name, which a rename would destroy, so the baseline and the .ripwire_quality_acks ledger are both re-filed into the CURRENT tree's identity before either is read, by two EXACT mechanisms — git's own rename record, and equality of a whitespace-and-name-scrubbed body hash — never a similarity heuristic. renames= is how many rename pairs were read, rename_window_commits= how deep the commit window went, acked_by_rename= and acked_by_content= how many of the acked= suppressions each mechanism is responsible for. Three appear ONLY when true, so an absent one is not a silent no: renames_window_truncated= (history is deeper than the window), renames_truncated= (the pair cap was hit), renames_ambiguous= (an ancestor two current symbols both claim — refused rather than guessed). ORIGIN reads the re-filed baseline too, so a regression carried in with a rename is judged preexisting-worse and GATES instead of slipping through as new-symbol. FLOORS, stated because silence here would read as a guarantee: the two clone kinds key on a member-SET hash and are NOT re-filed, so a clone ack still dies on a rename; ORIGIN follows the rename record but never content, because the baseline stores no content id at all; and a move git recorded no rename for still reads as new-symbol. Each sa row carries key= (the ack identity as stored) and why=, which is target-gone (the key names no symbol or group any more) or finding-gone (the target survived, this kind just does not fire on it). sym= and p=path:line name WHICH ack it is, and are present exactly when the key still names a live symbol: on every finding-gone row, on none of the target-gone rows (there is nothing left to name), and on neither clone kind — a clone key hashes a member SET that no single symbol carries, so those rows are unnameable by construction rather than guessed at. Hygiene disclosure only — the ledger file is never auto-edited. ROWS: sym= is the canonical id the finding regressed on; was= and now= carry the before/after value for the numeric kinds; p="path:line" is the locator (root-relative; the first-sorting member for the clone kinds; omitted, never faked, when none resolves). churn= and surface= are per-kind classification facets (short-horizon-churn's self/ambient split; api-surface's new-symbol/contract-change tier). churn= facets never gate alone: the kind gates only on 2+ COMMITTED in-window rewrites of the edited lines. Every row the header's gating= counter counts also carries a gating attribute set to 1 — marked positively, never by the ABSENCE of sev or origin. CLONE ROWS name the whole group rather than one symbol: members= is the member list and tokens= its shared normalized-token count (the same per-group pair the clones verb reports). idiom= names a RECOGNIZED BODY SHAPE every member spells, out of a closed set of three (threshold-ladder, switch-name-table, builder-chain). idiom= alone changes nothing; a group that ALSO shares no non-keyword identifier between any two members, sits in pairwise-distinct enclosing contexts, and stays under 80 normalized tokens is an idiom COLLISION rather than a copy, and is reported minor instead of gating. Break any one of those and it gates as before, idiom= and all: two bucketing ladders over the SAME enum are a copy. The shape is read off the body's token stream and not a parse tree, so a macro-assembled body classifies as whatever its raw tokens spell — the name is printed so the call can be overruled by reading. SCOPE, present only when the scope flag was given, and it NARROWS WHAT THIS REPORT CLAIMS: scope= is the pattern list it was given, verbatim. Every counter above (regressions=, minor=, acked=, preexisting-worse=, new-symbol=, gating=) is then over the IN-SCOPE findings alone, and the exit code follows gating= as always. The rest are not dropped: scoped-out= counts the findings filed to somebody else, and every one of them is printed inside an out-of-scope element carrying n= (the same count), would-gate= and note= (the do-not-ack banner). scoped-out-gating= repeats would-gate= on the root because it is the number a reader must not miss: it is how many disclosed rows WOULD have fired the exit code, so exit 0 under a scope means "nothing of YOURS is broken", never "the tree is clean". Rows inside that element carry the identical attributes to the ones above it and never carry the gating attribute, since they are not what this exit code fires on. HOW A FINDING IS FILED: by its p= path, matched root-relative against the patterns; a clone kind is in scope when ANY member matches, not just the first-sorting one; and a finding with no locator at all is filed OUT of scope, because under a scope "we cannot say where this is" honestly reads as not provably yours. -->

## `./build/ripwire . --edit-check=lessByScoreDescId`

*The closed loop: contract unchanged (same params, same publicness) after the replace — nothing provably incompatible.*

`````
<!-- ripwire edit-check: SYM's contract (param count + publicness) NOW vs git HEAD — unchanged/new-symbol/contract-change, or no-baseline when the root has no git HEAD to compare against (not a repository, or no commit yet): then NOTHING is claimed about the contract, and a symbol is never called new for want of a baseline — plus its 1-hop callers. A caller is flagged incompatible="1" when its argument count was reliably counted and NO definition in the folded set could accept it: every one has a FIXED arity that disagrees. A variadic, defaulted or implicit-receiver definition (a Python/Ruby method, whose params counts the self/cls the call site never writes) has no fixed arity and is never flagged. That makes the ARITY half one-sided — a call the compared definitions could accept is never flagged — but it is NOT a proof that the call site binds to THIS definition. Call edges are matched by NAME, so a receiver-qualified call to a same-named callee this tool does not index (a standard-library or third-party method) is measured against the one definition it does index; a clean, compiling tree can therefore carry a nonzero incompatible= with nothing edited at all, and on a widely-shared name it can be most of that name's callers. Read incompatible= as a fact about the tree as it stands — call sites worth OPENING, not a verdict — and status= as a fact about the edit. Warm path hits the qheadsnap/qsnap cache — never a full quality-delta style recompute. defs= is how many DEFINITIONS at this site (same file, same scope, same name — the overload set) are folded into this one contract; a selector matching more than one SITE is refused instead, so defs= only ever counts overloads. params_was and params_now are the MAX over that set on each side (the same MAX the baseline snapshot stores), and publicness is the OR. That MAX has TWO consequences, in opposite directions. It can read like a break and not be one: adding a WIDER overload beside an unchanged one raises params_now with no existing definition altered, so it reports status="contract-change" with incompatible="0" and a def row still carrying the old parameter count — no seen caller breaks. And it can read like safety and not be: REMOVING an overload whose parameter count is BELOW the MAX moves neither number, because the MAX survives on both sides, while the call site that used the removed definition no longer binds. defs_was=/defs_now= is what closes that: the count of definitions sharing this symbol's DEFINITION SITE — same file, same scope, same name — on each side. That is the population the baseline snapshot buckets by, so the two numbers answer the same question and are equal on an unedited tree. A same-named definition in ANOTHER FILE is a different contract and is counted on neither side, so defs_now= agrees with the root's defs= by construction and only defs_was= can move it. status is therefore the join of THREE was-vs-now facts — the params MAX, publicness, and the definition COUNT — and change= names which of them carried it. change= adds broken-callers when a seen caller is also flagged, but never on its own — for the reason stated at the top: incompatible= describes the TREE and status= describes the EDIT, so a headline must not turn on it. RESIDUAL: an overload whose arity changes BELOW the MAX while the COUNT stays the same moves none of the three. The root's incompatible= is the COUNT of flagged callers (a c row's incompatible="1" is the per-caller flag). sites_l= rides on a flagged row only: a c row's p= is where that CALLER is DEFINED, and sites_l= is the ascending LINE list of its call-role reference sites to this name — the lines to open, the same rows the uses verb prints, including the ones whose argument count could not be counted (so sites_l= can be wider than the evidence the flag rests on). Two calls on one line are ONE site. p= is the definition the selector resolved to; when defs is above 1 EVERY folded definition is listed as its own def row (p=, t=, params=), which is what tells a widened single definition apart from an added overload. At defs="1" no def row is emitted: the root's own p=/t= is that definition, and params_now is its parameter count. next= is the one pasteable follow-up: on a contract-change the uses verb on SYM (the call sites), otherwise the test gate on the definition's file. est_tokens= prices THIS document, through the tool's ONE emitted-bytes estimator. counts_floor="1" means every count here is a FLOOR, never a total: edges are extracted from source TEXT by NAME. Missing: dynamic dispatch (virtual/interface/duck-typed), a most-vexing-parse declaration with no call expression, a function-pointer/callback bound to more than one function in scope (reassigned, table-indexed, lambda-bound, or address-taken/reference-bound), and a plain-name binding (fp=handler) whose variable type is not PROVABLY a function pointer (a same-file typedef/declarator; a HEADER typedef is missed; auto/template types are read as unpinned, so KEPT). A macro-generated call site is role="macro" only when its name uniquely names an indexed function-like #define (C-family, t="macro"); a shared name stays a plain call, an unindexed macro is no edge. Read a zero as "none found", never as "none exists". graph_ambiguous=/graph_unresolved= are the whole graph's resolver gauge (calls split over several defs / calls whose in-repo defs were all language-filtered), the map header's ambiguous=/unresolved=. graph_unindexed=N is a third gauge: files no grammar could read (the map header's unindexed=), whose calls raise neither gauge above; absent when zero, and so is this sentence. COUNTING UNIT differs by verb: callers, callees, edit-check, graph-query and pr-context counts are DISTINCT SYMBOLS (repeated calls from one caller, and calls to two overloads, collapse into ONE row; multiplicity survives only in the call graph's edge weight). The reach counts (impact's reaches=, pr-context's dependents=) are the size of a transitive reach SET, each symbol counted once. The uses verb counts call SITES, one row per occurrence — a larger count there for the same symbol is these units agreeing, not disagreeing. The map header's edges= is a unit again different — distinct (caller,callee) PAIRS — and that document carries neither this marker nor this clause. -->

<!-- ripwire quality-delta: only what a change made WORSE against the floor baseline= names below. Descriptive: weigh and fix the real ones, do not game the number (a wrong abstraction beats a low score). TEN KINDS, and kind= on every row names which one: complexity over the ccx bar, verbosity (LOC), nesting, params, duplication, dead-code, api-surface (new public contract drift), error-masking, short-horizon-churn, new-clone-of-reused-helper. THREE independent axes, in this order: (1) acked findings are suppressed entirely (acked= counts them); (2) ORIGIN — a finding on a symbol that EXISTED at the baseline is preexisting-worse (no origin attribute), one that exists only because the code is NEW carries origin="new-symbol"; (3) MATERIALITY — a small numeric delta is sev="minor", and minor= counts them. EXIT 2 fires only on preexisting-worse AND major, the gating= count; new-symbol rows never gate, so exit 0 is NOT a verdict on them — nothing that existed got worse, but the new debt is yours: read them. Clone kinds are new-symbol only when EVERY member is new; short-horizon-churn is preexisting by construction. preexisting-worse= and new-symbol= partition regressions=. stale= is a FOURTH axis, never gating and never counted in regressions=: rows in the .ripwire_quality_acks ledger whose target no longer applies. api-new-surface= COUNTS the new PUBLIC symbols (never gates, not in regressions=, printed even at zero). register-macro-excluded= is a FLOOR, not a finding: symbols this run excluded from the dead-code kind because their own definition is a registered self-registering test/benchmark macro call. Never gates, never counted in regressions=, printed even at zero (zero means none excluded, not that the check did not run). A gating row's next= is the one pasteable follow-up: expand on FILE:NAME, the body to fix (a duplication row names a SET and carries none). bar= on a complexity/verbosity/nesting/params row is the threshold now= is judged against (ccx 15, loc 60, nest 4, params 5). baseline="git-HEAD" means no sidecar existed, so the working tree was auto-compared against the HEAD tree — anything already committed cannot appear. at= is the git commit (plus a dirty marker when the working tree differs) this list was computed at. The registered families are doctest/Catch2 TEST_CASE, GoogleTest TEST/TEST_F/TEST_P, Google Benchmark BENCHMARK, plus any name a .ripwire_config register_macros= line adds; each registers itself through a static initializer the call graph cannot see, so zero in-edges on one is not evidence of anything. IDENTITY across a rename or a move: a finding is keyed path::scope::name, which a rename would destroy, so the baseline and the .ripwire_quality_acks ledger are both re-filed into the CURRENT tree's identity before either is read, by two EXACT mechanisms — git's own rename record, and equality of a whitespace-and-name-scrubbed body hash — never a similarity heuristic. renames= is how many rename pairs were read, rename_window_commits= how deep the commit window went, acked_by_rename= and acked_by_content= how many of the acked= suppressions each mechanism is responsible for. Three appear ONLY when true, so an absent one is not a silent no: renames_window_truncated= (history is deeper than the window), renames_truncated= (the pair cap was hit), renames_ambiguous= (an ancestor two current symbols both claim — refused rather than guessed). ORIGIN reads the re-filed baseline too, so a regression carried in with a rename is judged preexisting-worse and GATES instead of slipping through as new-symbol. FLOORS, stated because silence here would read as a guarantee: the two clone kinds key on a member-SET hash and are NOT re-filed, so a clone ack still dies on a rename; ORIGIN follows the rename record but never content, because the baseline stores no content id at all; and a move git recorded no rename for still reads as new-symbol. The two mechanisms in full, because a suppression is a claim about identity: git's rename record is read with rename detection and the similarity threshold PINNED in the command, never inherited from the repo config, over a fixed COMMIT window rather than a wall-clock one, so the answer is the same everywhere; the content match is equality of a body hash scrubbed of whitespace and of the symbol's own name, for a move git recorded no rename for. A body that CHANGED is a different finding and is matched by neither. Each sa row carries key= (the ack identity as stored) and why=, which is target-gone (the key names no symbol or group any more) or finding-gone (the target survived, this kind just does not fire on it). sym= and p=path:line name WHICH ack it is, and are present exactly when the key still names a live symbol: on every finding-gone row, on none of the target-gone rows (there is nothing left to name), and on neither clone kind — a clone key hashes a member SET that no single symbol carries, so those rows are unnameable by construction rather than guessed at. Hygiene disclosure only — the ledger file is never auto-edited. ROWS: sym= is the canonical id the finding regressed on; was= and now= carry the before/after value for the numeric kinds; p="path:line" is the locator (root-relative; the first-sorting member for the clone kinds; omitted, never faked, when none resolves). churn= and surface= are per-kind classification facets (short-horizon-churn's self/ambient split; api-surface's new-symbol/contract-change tier). churn= facets never gate alone: the kind gates only on 2+ COMMITTED in-window rewrites of the edited lines. Every row the header's gating= counter counts also carries a gating attribute set to 1 — marked positively, never by the ABSENCE of sev or origin. CLONE ROWS name the whole group rather than one symbol: members= is the member list and tokens= its shared normalized-token count (the same per-group pair the clones verb reports). idiom= names a RECOGNIZED BODY SHAPE every member spells, out of a closed set of three (threshold-ladder, switch-name-table, builder-chain). idiom= alone changes nothing; a group that ALSO shares no non-keyword identifier between any two members, sits in pairwise-distinct enclosing contexts, and stays under 80 normalized tokens is an idiom COLLISION rather than a copy, and is reported minor instead of gating. Break any one of those and it gates as before, idiom= and all: two bucketing ladders over the SAME enum are a copy. The shape is read off the body's token stream and not a parse tree, so a macro-assembled body classifies as whatever its raw tokens spell — the name is printed so the call can be overruled by reading. -->

<!-- ripwire quality-delta: only what a change made WORSE against the floor baseline= names below. Descriptive: weigh and fix the real ones, do not game the number (a wrong abstraction beats a low score). TEN KINDS, and kind= on every row names which one: complexity over the ccx bar, verbosity (LOC), nesting, params, duplication, dead-code, api-surface (new public contract drift), error-masking, short-horizon-churn, new-clone-of-reused-helper. THREE independent axes, in this order: (1) acked findings are suppressed entirely (acked= counts them); (2) ORIGIN — a finding on a symbol that EXISTED at the baseline is preexisting-worse (no origin attribute), one that exists only because the code is NEW carries origin="new-symbol"; (3) MATERIALITY — a small numeric delta is sev="minor", and minor= counts them. EXIT 2 fires only on preexisting-worse AND major, the gating= count; new-symbol rows never gate, so exit 0 is NOT a verdict on them — nothing that existed got worse, but the new debt is yours: read them. Clone kinds are new-symbol only when EVERY member is new; short-horizon-churn is preexisting by construction. preexisting-worse= and new-symbol= partition regressions=. stale= is a FOURTH axis, never gating and never counted in regressions=: rows in the .ripwire_quality_acks ledger whose target no longer applies. api-new-surface= COUNTS the new PUBLIC symbols (never gates, not in regressions=, printed even at zero). register-macro-excluded= is a FLOOR, not a finding: symbols this run excluded from the dead-code kind because their own definition is a registered self-registering test/benchmark macro call. Never gates, never counted in regressions=, printed even at zero (zero means none excluded, not that the check did not run). A gating row's next= is the one pasteable follow-up: expand on FILE:NAME, the body to fix (a duplication row names a SET and carries none). bar= on a complexity/verbosity/nesting/params row is the threshold now= is judged against (ccx 15, loc 60, nest 4, params 5). baseline="sidecar" is the pinned .ripwire_quality_baseline snapshot, honored because it was pinned at the CURRENT git HEAD: the one floor YOU chose. baseline_absorbed="N" means that sidecar was pinned with the allow-dirty flag on a tree that ALREADY held N gating finding(s) against HEAD, and those N are inside the floor: a green exit beside this attribute reads "clean since the pin", never "clean". Re-pin on a committed tree to clear it. at= is the git commit (plus a dirty marker when the working tree differs) this list was computed at. The registered families are doctest/Catch2 TEST_CASE, GoogleTest TEST/TEST_F/TEST_P, Google Benchmark BENCHMARK, plus any name a .ripwire_config register_macros= line adds; each registers itself through a static initializer the call graph cannot see, so zero in-edges on one is not evidence of anything. IDENTITY across a rename or a move: a finding is keyed path::scope::name, which a rename would destroy, so the baseline and the .ripwire_quality_acks ledger are both re-filed into the CURRENT tree's identity before either is read, by two EXACT mechanisms — git's own rename record, and equality of a whitespace-and-name-scrubbed body hash — never a similarity heuristic. renames= is how many rename pairs were read, rename_window_commits= how deep the commit window went, acked_by_rename= and acked_by_content= how many of the acked= suppressions each mechanism is responsible for. Three appear ONLY when true, so an absent one is not a silent no: renames_window_truncated= (history is deeper than the window), renames_truncated= (the pair cap was hit), renames_ambiguous= (an ancestor two current symbols both claim — refused rather than guessed). ORIGIN reads the re-filed baseline too, so a regression carried in with a rename is judged preexisting-worse and GATES instead of slipping through as new-symbol. FLOORS, stated because silence here would read as a guarantee: the two clone kinds key on a member-SET hash and are NOT re-filed, so a clone ack still dies on a rename; ORIGIN follows the rename record but never content, because the baseline stores no content id at all; and a move git recorded no rename for still reads as new-symbol.
